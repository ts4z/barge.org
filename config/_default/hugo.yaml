  # Keep these short so they're one line on a phone.  35 characters is great,
  # 40 will probably wrap on an iPhone SE.

  # CTAs are added to (almost) all pages at the top in an obnoxious yellow box.
  # Each CTA should be made of a link and a display text.  Any number of CTAs
  # are supported, but try to limit yourself to one or two.  As with
  # nextEvents, these will wrap if they get too long.
