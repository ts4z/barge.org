all slides will remain hidden.

Perhaps you think that hugo should have a facility for doing thsi
automatically.  Perhaps it does.  And it almost works, except in debug mode,
where it only works once (because the Page structure carries over across
regenerations, that's why).  Better to just do it by hand and write a long
snarky comment about it, then try to remember why I put the hack in later.
