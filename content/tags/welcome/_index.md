The BARGE Welcoming Committee is a informal group of BARGErs who help
first-time attendees (read: Virgins) get acclimated, meet people and just
generally have a great time!  They can be identified by some sort of special
thingy on their name badges - but most likely, they'll find you if you don't
find them!
 
For some articles written by the BARGE Welcoming Committee, they can be found
below!
