This site is the online home for BARGE and EMBARGO, and a pointer to several
other similar events.

[BARGE](/barge) is the Big [August](/blog/what-does-the-a-stand-for)
Rec.Gambling Excursion, a group of gambling enthusiasts that spun off of the
rec.gambling newsgroup, which has been occurring annually since 1991.

[EMBARGO](/embargo), the Extraordinary Mid-winter Big Annual Rec.Gambling
Outing, is a smaller companion event occurring in the winter since 2011.

Several [other events](/other-events) exist, hosted in other places in the
U.S., but they have different web sites.

[Barge.org](/) has been around since 1997 or so.  This site has hosted event
information and registration for almost all of that time, and an increasing
amount of never-quite-completed content.

[BARGE, Inc.](/inc) is a 501(c)7 corporation registered in the State of Nevada,
and provides a corporate structure for frivolity.
