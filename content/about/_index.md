This site is the online home for BARGE and EMBARGO, and a pointer to several
other similar events.

Rec.Gambling Excursion, which has been occurring annually since 1991.
[EMBARGO](/embargo) is a companion event occurring in the winter since 2011.
Several [other events](/other-events) exist, hosted in other places in the
U.S., but they have different web sites.

information and registration for almost all of that time, and an increasing
amount of never-quite-completed content.

[BARGE, Inc.](/inc) is a 501(c)7 corporation registered in the State of Nevada,
and provides a corporate structure for frivolity.
