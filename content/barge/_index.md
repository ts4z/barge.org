BARGE is the **Big Annual Rec.Gambling Excursion** (to Las Vegas). This is our
annual venture out of cyberspace into the Real World in which we get together
to meet each other face-to-face, participate in several BARGE-private events,
and generally blow off steam (not hard to do in Las Vegas in July/August).

In order to participate in BARGE: you must register via the Internet.

### Location

[BARGE 2025]({{< relref "2025/" >}}) will be held at the Orleans Hotel &amp; Casino!

### Registration

Registration for BARGE 2025 is not yet open.
        
### Who is Eligible to Register for BARGE?
              
Registrations are available to anyone who wishes to join our community.

The organizers reserve the right to deny participation in any or all BARGE 
events to anyone, at their discretion.  Registrations must be performed 
online and by the registrant personally (no third-party registrations). 
An exception is made for Significant Others. 

### Guests

Upon payment of the appropriate event fee you may register guests 
for any of the non-tournament events (banquet, symposium). No additional 
registration fee applies.

### Assignment of Registration

A registration is to be considered an exclusive agreement between the 
registrant and the BARGE Organizers, and may not be assigned to 
another party without their prior agreement.

### Cancellation of BARGE Events 

Should any event (or all events) associated with BARGE be canceled, 
BARGE's limitation of liability is the amount of the fee paid for the 
canceled event. In no case will the registration fee be refunded as 
it covers costs we incur at the time of registration.

All fees mentioned are used to cover expenses or are placed into the BARGE 
fund.

### Cancellation or other Changes to Registrations

All registrations are final. Cancellations and additions to your BARGE
registration will be done through the close of registration and are
subject to the non-refundable membership fee. Refunds for cancellations
after the close of registration are at the sole discretion of the BARGE
organizers. In no case will the membership fee be refunded. No refunds
will be issued until September 2025.
       
### Disputed Charges

Please bring all charge disputes to the attention of the organizers
prior to contacting your bank. Anyone who files a dispute with a bank
prior to trying to resolve the problem with the organizers will be
barred from attending this or any future BARGE.
       
### Non-Smoking

All BARGE events are non-smoking.

### So Who Are the &quot;Organizers&quot; Anyway?

probably who you want to work with.  A list of directors can be found
