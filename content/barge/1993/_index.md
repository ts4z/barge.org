Following the [1992 event](../1992/), A second meet-up was planned at the Rio, and 18 people played in a two-table poker tournament at that venue. Roy Hashimoto was the eventual winner. He flew into town the day of the tournament, and flew out after winning. It isn't known who finished second, but Stephen &quot;Bozo&quot; Blackstock finished 3rd. Also at the event was BARGE organizer and current BARGE organizer emeritus, Chuck Weinstock. Frank Irwin organized the tournament at the Rio.
