Notes
-----

#### (1) 

No Limit Hold’em Crapshoot plays like regular No Limit Hold’em, except in lieu
of a turn card, the button rolls two dice. The roll of the dice represents the
value of the rank of the turn “card” (a value of 11 is a Jack, a value of 12 is
a Queen, and the turn “card” can never be a King or an Ace). The turn “card”
has no suit UNLESS: (a) craps (2, 3, or 12) is rolled in which case the turn
“card” plays as any suit, (b) hard four (2-2) or six (3-3) is rolled in which
case the turn “card” plays as any black suit, or (c) hard eight (4-4) or hard
ten (5-5) is rolled in which case the turn “card” plays as any red suit. If the
button rolls a 7 or 11, they win a big blind from the pot (if the player was
all in, winning the big blind from the pot makes them no longer all in pending
turn and river action). If the button rolls craps (2, 3, or 12), they must pay
two big blinds to the pot (unless they are all in)

* Unlimited $60 rebuys during first hour (must be below starting stack); all players may add-on for $60 at first break
* all rebuy/add-on proceeds to be donated to winner’s choice of a variety of charities to be announced

#### (2)

Limit single draw A-5 lowball with a bug

#### (3)

* $25 bounty on all players
* Tournament plays 18 levels (~6 hours), then prize pool will be distributed among the remaining players proportional to their chip count

#### (4)

* Played 6 handed limit.
* Players are dealt 6 cards and separate them into three 2 card Hold’em hands;
  one hand is discarded after the flop (before the betting) and one hand is
  discarded after the turn (before the betting)

* Snacks from KoMex will be served (if allowed by Westgate)

#### (7)
