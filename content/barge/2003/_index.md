This is the last year our most frequent host casino would bear the
&quot;Horseshoe&quot; name, and be run by a Binion.

Keith Fichtemaier won the limit hold'em event. Tiger came in second
and Mike &quot;ADB Howler&quot; McBride finished third. Team Chinese Poker won
the Team CHORSE event. This was the last year for the History of Poker
event. It was won by Michael Maurer with Perry &quot;The Baiter&quot; Friedman
and Jerrod Ankenman finishing second and third. In the ToC-style event, Gavin
Smith was victorious over Gillian Groves followed by David Huberman. Howard
Lederer spoke at the banquet which was held upstairs at Binion's. The NL
hold'em tournament winner was Paul Person. Patti Beadles finished second and
John Davis came in third. Mike Zimmers helped organize this year's BARGE event,
but he chose not to attend, marking the end of his illustrious career as BARGE
organizer.
