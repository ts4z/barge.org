Once again, the entirety of BARGE 2011 occurred at Binion's Casino in beautiful
downtown Las Vegas. 

The Tuesday
tournament this year was one of the rarer games spread in tournament form these
days: limit hold'em. It was won by a late-arriving David Kluchman followed by
Len Greenberg and Sharon Goldman. On Wednesday David Heller won the blackjack
tournament with Michael Maurer emerging victorious in the video poker
event. That evening in the draw lowball tournament the finishing order was
Chris Mecklin, Scott Byron, and Joe Long. On Thursday &quot;Team I Don't Give a
Damn&quot; won the team CHORSE event, and that evening it was Spencer Sun
winning the 6-game event with David Low and Arthur Goltz winding up in second
and third, respectively. On Friday it was Steve Lewin-Berlin winning the
Tournament of Champions-style tournament, followed by John &quot;JRX&quot; Reed
and &quot;Timmer&quot; Stine. 

Our banquet speaker was Mori Eskandani. 

The winner of the BARGE main event, the no-limit hold'em tournament, was Rich
&quot;Omahalic&quot; Bremer ahead of second place Rodney Chen and third place
Dave Tahajian.

This was the last BARGE as organizer for Peter Secor, who continues as
an honored organizer emeritus.
