BARGE had some last minute problems finding a home in 2006, ostensibly due to
licensing issues surrounding some online poker sponsors for the
event. Originally, the event was going to be held at the Plaza again, but they
pulled out at the 11th hour. Caesars and The Palms were discussed as possible
hosts, but in the end the Venetian stepped up and did a fabulous job hosting
BARGE. The banquet was held at the Venetian and Phil Gordon was the
speaker. The NL tournament winner was Mordecai Schwartz. David
&quot;Heldar&quot; Heller finished second, and Don &quot;ADB Bingo&quot; Rieck
came in third. The Tuesday tournament in 2006 was Lazy Pineapple, and that was
won by Keith Troell, followed by Warren Sander in second and Claude Carlson in
third. In the newly christened &quot;Mike Zimmers Memorial&quot; lowball event
Kenny Shei won with Bob Jones and Randy &quot;Schmengie&quot; Collack coming in
second and third. The &quot;Icicles&quot; won the Team CHORSE event. Jeff
Landgraf won the stud shootout with Daniel Lykins in second and Nolan &quot;ADB
Darkside&quot; Dalla in third. Don Condit won the ToC-style event with Steve
&quot;Lunchbox&quot; Forcash and Bill Campion close behind. In an upset, or so
Perry insists, Barry Goren beat tiltboy Perry &quot;The Baiter&quot; Friedman
in the World Roshambo Championship. Rick &quot;Zbigniew&quot; Bevan was awarded
the prize for best chip castle.
