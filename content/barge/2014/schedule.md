(1) Returning from a multi-year absence, the History of Poker tournament will consist of three games played in rotation: Ace to Five Lowball (aka California lowball, formerly of the Zimmers Memorial Lowball Tournament), Five-Card Draw (high), and Five-Card Stud (high). At later levels Five-Card Stud will not be part of the rotation.

(2) Players in the Blackjack tournament are expected to toke the dealers. Players in the Video Poker tournament are expected to toke the tournament staff. Players in the Craps tournament are expected to toke the game staff.

(3) The 6 games will be: hold'em, Omaha/8, razz, stud, stud/8, and lazy pineapple. Each game will be played for eight hands, the rotation will be the same for all tables, and it will be determined randomly at the start of the event.

(4) This is a team event. Teams (6 people) should appoint a captain, then have the captain email Kevin "Un" with the team name and a listing of all team members with their email addresses. Entries will be accepted on a first-come, first-served basis. Fees are not paid in advance with BARGE registrations. Team captains must pay the entire $430 on-site 1/2 hour prior to the tourney.

(5) Players must be registered as a significant other to play. This is intended to be a fun beginner's event. Please do not register for this if you have any significant poker experience. If you've won a BARGE SO event before, or have played in SO events for two or more straight years, we strongly encourage you to step up to one of the main events. You're ready! Make the jump!

(6) The banquet will be held on Saturday evening 8/2/2014 at 6:00pm in the Longhorn Room on the second floor directly above the poker tournament area (formerly known as Benny's Bullpen.)

Note that in some cases we're taking a break from our longer tournaments when the final table is formed to allow for other events. The final table will be played later in the evening as shown.
