In 2020, the COVID pandemic kept BARGE out of Las Vegas for the first and only time to date.
BARGE returned to its roots, the Internet, and our tournaments were held on Cliff Matthews' poker site,
now known as [Craft Poker](https://craftpoker.com/).

Russ Fox became the first two-time winner of the BARGE Main Event.
Historians will argue if a zero-dollar virtual tournament win counts (it does).
