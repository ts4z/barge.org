The year 2000 marked BARGE's return to the Horseshoe. Jeff Bartoszewicz won the
NL hold'em tournament, John &quot;JRX&quot; Reed finished second, and Stephen
&quot;Bozo&quot; Blackstock finished 3rd. Chris &quot;Jesus&quot; Ferguson was
the banquet speaker and winner of the chip castle building contest. No video
poker or blackjack tournament was held this year. This was the first year for
the Tournament of Champions-style event, in honor of BARGEr and ToC winner,
Spencer &quot;Zorak&quot; Sun. The winner of this event was Tony
&quot;Karma&quot; Goldstein. Peter &quot;Fold'em&quot; Secor finished second,
and Jeff Siegel finished third. I believe the History of Poker event was first
played at this BARGE, featuring alternating rounds of 5-card stud, 5-card draw
high, and 5-card draw lowball. After the early rounds, 5-card stud was removed
and the other games were played no-limit. In the final rounds, only lowball was
played. Michael Hunter, Stephen Landrum, and Bill Chen chopped the prize pool
when it got to 3-handed.
