BARGE was held at the Orleans this year for the first and only time
(although this will change in [2025](../2025/))
likely due to the change in ownership.

The NL hold'em tournament saw 177 people enter. John Harkness won, Russ
Rosenblum finished second, and Doug Langdon finished third. Rick Mombourquette
won the blackjack tournament. 

Mike Sexton was the banquet speaker.

1999 marked the first year in which the &quot;virgin&quot; class was
specifically called out, led by [&quot;virgin queen&quot; Beth
Evan](/resources/virgin-queen/).
