BARGE was held at the Orleans this year for the first[^1] time.

[^1]: We returned to the Orleans in [2025](../2025/).

The NL hold'em tournament saw 177 people enter. John Harkness won, Russ
Rosenblum finished second, and Doug Langdon finished third. Rick Mombourquette
won the blackjack tournament. 

Mike Sexton was the banquet speaker.  Mike was discussing the Tournament of
Champions (TOC), created by Mike as well as Chuck Humphries.  The TOC was an
attempt to make a comprehensive tournament that covered all of the most popular
games: Limit Hold'em, Limit Omaha/8, and limit Stud, followed by a No Limit
Hold'em final table.  BARGE has been running a TOC-Style tournament since 2000,
greatly outlasting the original event[^2]. 

1999 marked the first year in which the &quot;virgin&quot; class was
specifically called out, led by ["virgin queen" Beth
Evan](/resources/virgin-queen/).

[^2]: The first two TOC events were won by rec.gambling folks, Chris "Jesus"
Ferguson and Spencer "Zorak" Sun.
