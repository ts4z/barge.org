BARGE was held at the Orleans this year for the first and only time (although this will change in [2025](../2025/)).
The NL hold'em tournament saw 177 people enter. John Harkness won, Russ
Rosenblum finished second, and Doug Langdon finished third. Rick Mombourquette
won the blackjack tournament. 1999 marked the first year in which the
&quot;virgin&quot; class was specifically called out, led by &quot;virgin
queen&quot; Beth Evan. Mike Sexton spoke at the banquet.
