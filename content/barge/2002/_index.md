As usual, BARGE was hosted at the Horseshoe again this year. The banquet took
place at the Golden Nugget. At the banquet, Linda Johnson and Steve Lipscomb
gave us a sneak preview of a television show with which they were involved that
would hit the airwaves a year later, the World Poker Tour. Andy Hughes won the
History of Poker tournament with Rich Strauss and Bob Herlien finishing second
and third. In the ToC-style tournament Chris Straghalis was victorious over
Steve Jacobs and Mike M. (Maurer?). ADV Vanguard won the Team CHORSE
event. This was the first year for the 7-card stud shootout. The winner of this
event was Don &quot;trythat&quot; Perry. John Miller came in second and Lenny
Augustine finished third. Mike McBride won the NL hold'em tournament outlasting
Andrew Prock and Gavin Smith. This was Peter Secor's first BARGE as an
organizer.
