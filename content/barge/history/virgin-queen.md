[posted & emailed to the BARGE mailing list]

I started playing poker in 1998 and discovered RGP shortly thereafter.  Since
it was summer, RGP was filled with threads regarding BARGE.  I felt like such a
newbie that I didn't feel comfortable taking a spontaneous trip to Vegas to
join the group, but I read the threads with interest.

By the next year, I had already gone to my first RGP event (ESCARGOT '99) and
was eager to attend my first BARGE.  <!--more--> After registering and signing up for the
mailing list, I read lots of discussion about a Calcutta.  Well, I had never
heard of a Calcutta and didn't have a clue.  Someone suggested that newcomers
form their own syndicate to pool their limited knowledge of the players.  I
wasn't sure if I would get much response, but I stepped forward and called out
for any interested &quot;Virgins&quot; like myself to email me.  Immediately I
received seven responses!  Eventually, we had a group of 20+ 1999 Escargot
Virgins who formed a syndicate (a successful one, I might add), won last-longer
challenges issued by the ADB'ers and the Boston BARGE Brigade, and generally
had a great time...especially since we had corresponded by email in advance and
didn't feel quite so lost by the time we arrived at BARGE.

Because we enjoyed hanging out together so much, we wanted to continue our
group at BARGE 2000.  We knew that we couldn't continue to be Virgins, so after
much discussion, we evolved into the ADV'ers (alt.deflowered.virgins).  In the
meantime, there have been successive Virgin groups: the 2000 Virgins led by
Scottro and the 2001 Virgins led by North Shore Mike.
