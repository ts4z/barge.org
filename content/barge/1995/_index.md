In 1995 Tom Sims beat out 112 other people to win the NL hold'em tournament. Michael Buck took second, Doug Gifford finished 3rd. Gillian Groves won the blackjack tournament, Rudy Tatay finished second. This was BARGE's first year at Binion's Horseshoe (as it was called at the time.) A majority of BARGEs from this point on would be held at the same venue. At the Symposium, poker author Mason Malmuth spoke. This was the first invited speaker at any BARGE event. This was the first BARGE for eventual organizer Nick Christenson. This was also the first truly &quot;organized&quot; BARGE, by Mike Zimmers and Chuck Weinstock.
