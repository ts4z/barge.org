Notes:

These are rounded up payouts and may deviate slightly (+/- $1)  from actual amounts awarded

Impressive that 7/10 teams made money; probably the worst placing Team Sleeping In has ever done.

At the Symposium, foldem renamed the Virgin Team the &quot;Like a Virgin
Team&quot; since only half of their members were actually virgins.
