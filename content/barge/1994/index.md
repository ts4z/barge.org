BARGE 1994 was organized by a committee that may or may not have included Lee
Jones, and was held at the Luxor.  Sixty players entered the poker tournament
which was won by Dave Hughes. In second place was Cliff &quot;Deadhead&quot;
Matthews. It is unknown who finished third. For the first time, a second
&quot;official&quot; event was added, a blackjack tournament. We have no record
of who won this event. As this was the first almost organized BARGE, attendance
really took off here. Much of what BARGE has become can be traced to this
event.
