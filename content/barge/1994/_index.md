BARGE 1994 was organized by a committee that may or may not have included Lee
Jones, and was held at the Luxor.  Sixty players entered the poker tournament
which was won by Dave Hughes. In second place was Cliff &quot;Deadhead&quot;
Matthews. It is unknown who finished third. 

For the first time, a second &quot;official&quot; event was added, a blackjack
tournament. We have no record of who won this event.

As this was the first almost organized BARGE, attendance really took off
here. Much of what BARGE has become can be traced to this event.

In fact, Chuck Weinstock tells us:

> I had an appointment to meet with Jim Albrecht at Binionâ€™s regarding 
> [ConJelCo](https://www.conjelco.com/)
> hosting results for the WSOP the following May. Mike Zimmers tagged along and
> we also discussed the idea of holding [BARGE 1995](../1995/) there. Jim
> wholeheartedly embraced us.
