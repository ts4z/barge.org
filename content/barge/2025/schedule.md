## Explanations

### Mixed Big O Memorial Charity Tournament

 - In memory of Bob Ogus, Tom Sims, and Rick Charles
 - Played pot limit during the rebuy period and limit thereafter (all played 8 or better high/low split)
 - Unlimited $60 rebuys during first hour (must be below starting stack)
 - All players may add-on for $60 at first break
 - all rebuy/add-on proceeds to be donated to winner’s choice of the Orlando
   Dog Training Club Inc. (Bob Ogus’s preferred charity), the American Cancer
   Society, the Midwest Center for Holocaust Education, Team Rubicon, Habitat
   for Humanity, Dogs On Deployment, and World Central Kitchen
 - featuring table shuffle reseating (seating at each table is redrawn at each break; button is awarded to player who last paid the big blind)

### Abridged History of Poker

 - Levels alternate between California Lowball and 5 Card Draw (guts to open)
 - Switch to No Limit 2-7 at final table or predetermined point in structure
 - featuring table shuffle reseating (seating at each table is redrawn at each break; button is awarded to player who last paid the big blind)

### TORSE

 - HORSE with 2-7 Triple Draw instead of Hold’em
 - featuring table shuffle reseating (seating at each table is redrawn at each break; button is awarded to player who last paid the big blind)

### Champions Bounty No Limit Hold'em With 2-7 Game

 - This event is modeled after both two recent/current WSOP events – the
   Champions Reunion and Hall of Fame Bounty events
 - Former BARGE main event champions each have a bounty
   - The amount of the bounty is $100 plus the last two digits of the year(s) that they won
     - For example, Tim Showalter would have a $124 bounty ($100+’24), Lee
       Jones would have a $198 bounty ($100+’98), and Rich Bremer would have a
       $134 bounty ($100+’11+’23)
     - Even though it was an online free event, Russ Fox gets credit for his
       2020 main event win[*](/chips/gallery/2021/) so his bounty would be $121 ($100+’01+’20)
   - Bounties are funded from the prize pool
   - Bounties apply to all reentries should a champion bust and reenter
 - Featuring:
   - 2-7 Game – players winning with 2-7 collect a big and small blind from each player dealt in the hand
   - ultra-flat payout structure – 30% of field paid
   - table shuffle reseating (seating at each table is redrawn at each break; button is awarded to player who last paid the big blind)

### Bidirectional Chowaha High/Low

 - After the flop betting, button rolls die to determine whether turn and river are dealt to right of flops or underneath flops
 - 4 card Chowaha played high/low split eight or better
 - featuring table shuffle reseating (seating at each table is redrawn at each break; button is awarded to player who last paid the big blind)

### Team CHORSE

 - this is a six person team event where each team member plays one CHORSE game
   (HORSE + Crazy Pineapple 8 or better)

### Blackjack

 - We will run a blackjack event in this time slot whether the Orleans can run a formal event or whether we run an informal event


### Pot Limit Omaha

 - Players start with 10k and get 2 lammers worth 5k each

### Mini Reindeer Games

 - Somewhat expanded roster of cash games
 - Game selection through registration

### Midnight Madness No Limit Hold’em

 - This event will mirror the [FARGO event Midnight Madness
   event](http://fargopoker.org/2023midnightmadness.pdf)
 - Uses cash game chips
 - Tournament runs without breaks for 2.5 hours or until all agree to end it;
   players keep the chips they have in front of them when the tournament ends

### TOC-Style

 - mix of limit Hold'em, Omaha/8 or better, Stud High before switching to no
   limit Hold'em with 1-2 tables remaining

### BARGE Annual Dinner

- Prime Rib Loft at the Orleans

### Whammy CAR

 - Limit, three game mix of Courchevel high (modified), Action Razz, Rio Bravo
   - [Courchevel](/rulebook/courchevel.html) – modified so that players are dealt three cards preflop and a flop window card is dealt; players receive their fourth card after the river; must use two from hand and three from board
   - [Action Razz](/rulebook/action-razz.html) – standard rules
   - [Rio Bravo](/rulebook/rio-bravo.html) – hold’em with a third down card dealt after the river
 - 5 betting rounds in each game
 - Deck includes one joker
   - In any game if the joker is in your hole cards, you cannot win at showdown, but if you win the pot without a showdown you get an extra big bet from everyone dealt in
   - In Courchevel and Rio Bravo, if the whammy appears on the board, the board is killed and replaced
   - In Action Razz, if the whammy appears on a player’s board, the player’s board is killed and replaced
 - featuring table shuffle reseating (seating at each table is redrawn at each break; button is awarded to player who last paid the big blind)

### Reindeer Games
