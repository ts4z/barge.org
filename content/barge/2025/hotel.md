The BARGE rates are $30 midweek, $71 weekend  Please note that we could not convince them to reduce/remove the $40.99 resort fee, so please take that into consideration when booking.

These rates are available from July 26-Aug 4, and can be booked from now through July 11, so make sure to book by then.

For those who are interested in suites, you can call the Orleans at 702-365-7050 and mention our group rate (or ask for Tracy Morgan - sales manager of our group).

Details on dinner and our guest speaker are coming soon.
