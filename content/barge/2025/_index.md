BARGE 2025 was [The Orleans Hotel &
Casino](https://orleans.boydgaming.com/) from July 28 through August 2.
This was our first time back at the Orleans since [1999](../1999/)!

Our banquet speaker was Chris "Fox" Wallace.  101 players entered the No Limit
event, won by Gillian “tegwin” Groves.  Tournaments included pot-limit Omaha,
Team CHORSE, a bounty no-limit tournament with a 2-7 game, the wonderfully
named Whammy CAR, and, in a true throwback, a Limit Hold'em tournament.
[Binglaha](/rulebook/binglaha.html) made its triumphant return to the Reindeer
Games.

We have [full results](results/) as well as the archived [schedule](schedule/)
and [tournament structures](2025_BARGE_Structures.pdf).
