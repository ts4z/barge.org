This page provides a brief history and time line of the BARGE event, held
annually in Las Vegas, NV. There are some omissions, especially in data
regarding the early years, and missing text in later years.. Any efforts to
fill in these gaps would be greatly appreciated.

## 1991

The SIGGRAPH conference (on high-end computer graphics) was held in Las Vegas at about the first weekend in August, 1991. Several regular participants of the rec.gambling USENET newsgroup decided to meet up at this conference, and thus BARGE was born. It was during this time frame that the &quot;presto&quot; story occurred, as well as the Frank Irwin green chip fishing expedition. Despite the lack of planned activities and despite the fact that the &quot;BARGE&quot; label wasn't applied until next year [I think], we count this as the first BARGE.

## 1992

In early August of 1992 ten intrepid rec.gamblers got together in a hotel room at the Mirage and held a private poker tournament. The participants were Edmond Hack, Steve Jacobs, Alan Mintz, John Tais, Martin Veneroso, Tyler Wong, and Mike Zimmers. Believed to be in attendance were Blair Houghton, Mike McClain, and Jonathan Rosenberg. In the tournament, Steve Jacobs won, Edmund Hack came in second, and John Tais finished third. Also at the second BARGE, an impromptu blackjack tournament was held. Note, that at this BARGE was Mike Zimmers, eventual BARGE organizer and current BARGE organizer emeritus. Also hanging around and perhaps participating in the blackjack tournament were Abdul Jalib M'Hall, Jeff Jennings, and Doug Shy.

## 1993

A second meet-up was planned at the Rio, and 18 people played in a two-table poker tournament at that venue. Roy Hashimoto was the eventual winner. He flew into town the day of the tournament, and flew out after winning. It isn't known who finished second, but Stephen &quot;Bozo&quot; Blackstock finished 3rd. Also at the event was BARGE organizer and current BARGE organizer emeritus, Chuck Weinstock. Frank Irwin organized the tournament at the Rio.

## 1994

Chuck and Mike organized BARGE 1994 which was held at the Luxor. Sixty players entered the poker tournament which was won by Dave Hughes. In second place was Cliff &quot;Deadhead&quot; Matthews. It is unknown who finished third. For the first time, a second &quot;official&quot; event was added, a blackjack tournament. We have no record of who won this event. As this was the first almost organized BARGE, attendance really took off here. Much of what BARGE has become can be traced to this event.

## 1995

In 1995 Tom Sims beat out 112 other people to win the NL hold'em tournament. Michael Buck took second, Doug Gifford finished 3rd. Gillian Groves won the blackjack tournament, Rudy Tatay finished second. This was BARGE's first year at Binion's Horseshoe (as it was called at the time.) A majority of BARGEs from this point on would be held at the same venue. At the Symposium, poker author Mason Malmuth spoke. This was the first invited speaker at any BARGE event. This was the first BARGE for eventual organizer Nick Christenson. This was also the first truly &quot;organized&quot; BARGE, by Mike Zimmers and Chuck Weinstock.

## 1996

BARGE 1996 was held at the Horseshoe. The NL tournament was won by organizer Mike &quot;KidZee&quot; Zimmers. Steve Jacobs won the blackjack tournament, Andy Latto finished second, and Frank Irwin finished third. This is the first year in which a video poker tournament was held, although we have no record of who won the event. The banquet was held at Yollie's, a Brazilian steakhouse on Paradise Blvd.. The speaker was poker author Mike Caro. Because he couldn't be heard in the dining room, the restaurant kindly allowed us to hold our seminar on the roof of the restaurant. Caro gave his talk while quite literally pacing back and forth along the ledge of the roof. This was the first BARGE banquet. This was the first BARGE for eventual organizer Peter Secor.

## 1997

The 1997 BARGE was also held at the Horseshoe. Steve Brecher won the NL tournament, which had 166 entries. John Reeves finished second, and Steve Russel finished third. 18 places were paid. Barry Tanenbaum won the blackjack event. Arnold &quot;The Bishop&quot; Snyder was the speaker at the banquet, held for the first time at the Golden Nugget. This year was also the first year that Chowaha was played in a licensed casino. 1997 was also the year of the David Sklansky BARGE Charity Freeze Out where Barry Tanenbaum, uh, &quot;came in second&quot;.

## 1998

Once again, at Binion's Horseshoe, 184 players competed in the NL hold'em tournament. Lee &quot;I do *so* have a sense of humor&quot; Jones won. Steve &quot;Crunch&quot; Daniel finished second, and Peter &quot;Taki&quot; Caldes finished third. Andy Latto won the blackjack tournament and Steve Jacobs finished second. This reversed their positions from the same event in 1996. Mike Caro was, again, the banquet speaker, this time at the Golden Nugget. Caro holds the distinction of being the only repeat banquet speaker in the history of BARGE. The first BARGE wedding (Kfish and Ratly) was held at BARGE 1997. It was officiated by Arnold &quot;The Bishop&quot; Snyder, reverend of the First Church of Blackjack and the previous year's banquet speaker. A second Sklansky Charity Freeze Out was held in which Russ Rosenblum beat David Skalansky in just a few hands.

## 1999

BARGE was held at the Orleans this year for the first and only time (to date.) The NL hold'em tournament saw 177 people enter. John Harkness won, Russ Rosenblum finished second, and Doug Langdon finished third. Rick Mombourquette won the blackjack tournament. 1999 marked the first year in which the &quot;virgin&quot; class was specifically called out, led by &quot;virgin queen&quot; Beth Evan. Mike Sexton spoke at the banquet.

## 2000

The year 2000 marked BARGE's return to the Horseshoe. Jeff Bartoszewicz won the NL hold'em tournament, John &quot;JRX&quot; Reed finished second, and Stephen &quot;Bozo&quot; Blackstock finished 3rd. Chris &quot;Jesus&quot; Ferguson was the banquet speaker and winner of the chip castle building contest. No video poker or blackjack tournament was held this year, this was the first year for the Tournament of Champions-style event, in honor of BARGEr and ToC winner, Spencer &quot;Zorak&quot; Sun. The winner of this event was Tony &quot;Karma&quot; Goldstein. Peter &quot;Fold'em&quot; Secor finished second, and Jeff Siegel finished third. I believe the History of Poker event was first played at this BARGE, featuring alternating rounds of 5-card stud, 5-card draw high, and 5-card draw lowball. After the early rounds, 5-card stud was removed and the other games were played no-limit. In the final rounds, only lowball was played. Michael Hunter, Stephen Landrum, and Bill Chen chopped the prize pool when it got to 3-handed. 

## 2001

In 2001, BARGE was again at Binion's Horseshoe. Events included the NL tournament, ToC-style tournament, and History of Poker tournament. The History of Poker tournament was won by Andy Bloch. Sean &quot;oscar&quot; McGuinness finished second, and Spencer Sun was third. At the ToC-style event, Frank Jerome emerged victorious over David Croson and Connie Kellers. The banquet was held at the Golden Nugget, the speaker was Phil Hellmuth. The NL winner was Russ Fox who outlasted John Fleming and Don &quot;ADB Bingo&quot; Rieck. The BARGE Chip Committee was formed and created this year's set. Eventual organizer Michael Patterson's first BARGE. [Complete results for BARGE 2001](/barge/results/2001)

## 2002

As usual, BARGE was hosted at the Horseshoe again this year. The banquet took place at the Golden Nugget. At the banquet, Linda Johnson and Steve Lipscomb gave us a sneak preview of a television show with which they were involved that would hit the airwaves a year later, the World Poker Tour. Andy Hughes won the History of Poker tournament with Rich Strauss and Bob Herlien finishing second and third. In the ToC-style tournament Chris Straghalis was victorious over Steve Jacobs and Mike M. (Maurer?). ADV Vanguard won the Team CHORSE event. This was the first year for the 7-card stud shootout. The winner of this event was Don &quot;trythat&quot; Perry. John Miller came in second and Lenny Augustine finished third. Mike McBride won the NL hold'em tournament outlasting Andrew Prock and Gavin Smith. This was Peter Secor's first BARGE as an organizer.

## 2003

After 2003, BARGE would still have a home at Binion's, but this is the last year the building would bear the &quot;Horseshoe&quot; name (and be run by a Binion.) Keith Fichtemaier won the limit hold'em event. Tiger came in second and Mike &quot;ADB Howler&quot; McBride finished third. Team Chinese Poker won the Team CHORSE event. This was the last year for the History of Poker event. It was won by Michael Maurer with Perry &quot;The Baiter&quot; Friedman and Jerrod Ankenman finishing second and third.

The NL hold'em tournament winner was Paul Person. Patti Beadles finished second and John Davis came in third. Mike Zimmers helped organize this year's BARGE event, but he chose not to attend, marking the end of his illustrious career as BARGE organizer. [Complete results for BARGE 2003](/barge/results/2003)

## 2004

Binion's again played host to BARGE in 2004. Newly crowned WSOP main event champion Greg &quot;Fossilman&quot; Raymer spoke at the banquet, which was held at the Four Queens.

## 2006

BARGE had some last minute problems finding a home in 2006, ostensibly due to licensing issues surrounding some online poker sponsors for the event. Originally, the event was going to be held at the Plaza again, but they pulled out at the 11th hour. Caesars and The Palms were discussed as possible hosts, but in the end the Venetian stepped up and did a fabulous job hosting BARGE. The banquet was held at the Venetian and Phil Gordon was the speaker. The NL tournament winner was Mordecai Schwartz. David &quot;Heldar&quot; Heller finished second, and Don &quot;ADB Bingo&quot; Rieck came in third. The Tuesday tournament in 2006 was Lazy Pineapple, and that was won by Keith Troell, followed by Warren Sander in second and Claude Carlson in third. In the newly christened &quot;Mike Zimmers Memorial&quot; lowball event Kenny Shei won with Bob Jones and Randy &quot;Schmengie&quot; Collack coming in second and third.

Once gain, BARGE enjoyed the hospitality of our good friends at Binion's. And, again, the banquet was held at the Golden Nugget where Tom Schneider spoke.

Mark &quot;Dagon&quot; Rafn came in second, and Steve &quot;Lunchbox&quot; Forcash finished third. The Tuesday event was the sadistic no-limit hold'em shootout transitioning to limit HORSE.

## 2020

In 2020, the COVID pandemic kept BARGE out of Las Vegas for the first and only time to date.
BARGE returned to its roots, the Internet, and our tournaments were held on Cliff Matthews' poker site,
now known as [Craft Poker](https://www.craftpoker.com/).

Russ Fox became the first two-time winner of the BARGE Main Event.
Historians will argue if a zero-dollar virtual tournament win counts (it does).

## 2021

This year's BARGE was at Westgate.  COVID was still quite present, and a lot of
Las Vegas was still closed.  COVID's Delta variant hit just before BARGE
and Nevada required staff to mask up.  Then, on Thursday, the players had to mask up, too.
We still played a lot of poker.
