In 2005, downtown Las Vegas was again host to BARGE. This time, though, the
host casino was the Plaza. 

Guy &quot;Grizz&quot; Berentsen won the charity pot-limit Omaha high
tournament. Sarah Boston came in second and Matthew Kursar finished third.
Steven Markowitz won the blackjack tournament, and Connie Kellers won the video
poker tournament.  Alex Ziselman won the Lowball event. Mark Trombley finished
second, and Barry Tanenbaum came in third.  &quot;Luck Factor Zero&quot; won
the Team CHORSE event.  Sabyl Cohen won the stud shootout. Ross Poppel came in
second, followed by Don &quot;ADB Bingo&quot; Rieck in third.  Mike
&quot;Oz&quot; Osborne won the ToC-style event. David Kuznick finished second,
and Sabyl Cohen was third.

The NL tournament winner was Don &quot;Trythat&quot; Perry. Nick Christenson
finished second, and Dave McVay came in third.

The banquet was held at the Plaza's sister property, the Las Vegas Club, and
Wil Wheaton was the speaker.

Chuck Weinstock earned the dubious distinction of missing a BARGE for which he
was the organizer, staying home to help his wife recover from back surgery.
