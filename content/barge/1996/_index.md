BARGE 1996 was held at the Horseshoe. The NL tournament was won by organizer
Mike &quot;KidZee&quot; Zimmers. Steve Jacobs won the blackjack tournament,
Andy Latto finished second, and Frank Irwin finished third. 

This is the first
year in which a video poker tournament was held, although we have no record of
who won the event. 

The banquet was held at Yollie's, a Brazilian steakhouse on
Paradise Blvd.. The speaker was poker author Mike Caro. Because he couldn't be
heard in the dining room, the restaurant kindly allowed us to hold our seminar
on the roof of the restaurant. Caro gave his talk while quite literally pacing
back and forth along the ledge of the roof. This was the first BARGE
banquet. 

Chuck Weinstock offers this advice from Mike's talk:

> “I am a lucky player. A powerful winning force surrounds me.”

This was the first BARGE for eventual organizer Peter Secor.
