Once again, BARGE enjoyed the hospitality of our good friends at Binion's. And,
again, the banquet was held at the Golden Nugget where Tom Schneider
spoke. While the team CHORSE even took place at the Nugget, the other
tournament events took place at Binion's. The NL hold'em tournament was won by
Dan Chevrie. Mark &quot;Dagon&quot; Rafn came in second, and Steve
&quot;Lunchbox&quot; Forcash finished third. The Tuesday event was the sadistic
no-limit hold'em shootout transitioning to limit HORSE. This event was won by
Guy &quot;Grizz&quot; Berentsen. In second was Chris &quot;Jepstonian&quot;
Jepsen. Bob Ogus finished in third place. Matt &quot;Grapes&quot; Grapenthein
won the blackjack event and Chic Natkins won the video poker tournament. In the
Zimmers Memorial Lowball event, Richard &quot;Quiet Lion&quot; Brodie took
first place. He was followed by Chris &quot;Tom Bayes&quot; Mecklin in second
and Ken &quot;ADB QB&quot; Kubey in third. Through means nobody quite
understands, Team Moosecock won the Team CHORSE event (even though there where,
what, only two real Canadians on the team?). Steve &quot;BIA&quot; Nissman won
the stud shootout followed by Stephen &quot;Marlin&quot; Cohen and Greg
Pappas. Barry Tanenbaum emerged victorious in the ToC-style event. Marc
&quot;The Occupant&quot; Gilutin came in second and Chuck Weinstock was
third. This was Chuck Weinstock's last BARGE as organizer, although he
continues as honored organizer emeritus. This was also Nick Christenson's first
BARGE as an organizer.
