Tuesday tournament moved to Wednesday. This year it was pot-limit
Binglaha. Caryl Aronson won. Keith Troell finished second. Bree Goldman was
third. Rich &quot;Omahalic&quot; Bremer won the blackjack event and Michael
Patterson was victorious in video poker. The Deadheads won the team CHORSE
event. Thursday evening Andrew Prock won the 6-game tournament with Rich
&quot;Omahalic&quot; Bremer finishing second and Arthur Reber coming in
third. In the Tournament of Champions-style event it was Steve Lewin-Berlin
winning it for a second year in a row, the first time that has happened in a
BARGE event. John Pickels came in second, and Rick Mombourquette was
third. Finally, the no-limit hold'em main event was won by Paul McMullin with
