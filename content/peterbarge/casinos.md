If you're in town for PeterBARGE, why not visit San Francisco?  Ride the cable
cars.  Catch a Giants game.  Marvel at the fog.  Or, Visit Lick Observatory in
San Jose.  Climb Mission Peak in Fremont.  See Six Flags Discovery Kingdom in
Vallejo or California's Great America in Santa Clara.

Because there's action all over the place, that's why.

All of these clubs are 24 hours.  None of them have even a single slot machine.

[Oaks Card Club](https://www.oakscardclub.com/) in Emeryville is near the
Townhouse in Emeryville, where we had our dinner in 2024.  They were great
hosts, and even spread a couple games for us.

The closest room to the Pinball Pirate is the [California
Grand](https://www.californiagrandcasino.com/) in Pacheco.  A bunch of us
played there in 2023.  We didn't tell them we were coming.  They were still
great.  There is a new player sign-up bonus.

If you find you're in the Bay Area for a little longer, or just in the mood for
a drive, [Bay 101](https://www.bay101.com/) and [Casino
M8trix](https://www.casinom8trix.com/) are in San Jose and near each other.  Of
the two, Bay 101 spreads more poker at more limits, including an 80-160 limit
hold'em game.  Both are very crowded on weekend nights.  [Lucky
Chances](https://www.luckychances.com/) is in Colma and has a large poker
room. It is usually the easiest place to find a seat on a weekend night.  Phone
ahead for a seat in the 3-5 game.  [Artichoke
Joe's](https://artichokejoes.com/) is near SFO. It spreads an ever-decreasing
amount of poker, but has a great bar.  They will likely have a 20-40 limit game
over the weekend.  The [Palace Poker
Casino](https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-palace-poker-casino-hayward) in Hayward is
a very small room.  They used to have a great no-limit game, but reportedly no
longer.

Most poker rooms allow phone-in for higher limits only.

Casinos will be busy on weekend nighs until around midnight.  Things start
thinning out around Last Call at around 1:15 or 1:30.
