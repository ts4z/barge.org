PeterBARGE was held again on November 9th and 10th in 2024, as Peter Secor was still unable to attend BARGE,
and also it was fun and we wanted it do it again.

We met Saturday night at the [Townhouse in
Emeryville](https://townhouseemeryville.com/), preceeded and followed by poker
at the nearby [Oaks Club](https://www.oakscardclub.com/).  They even let us run
a player-dealt lowball game.  Sabyl got a text during dinner letting us know
they found the bugs!

Our tournament was held on Sunday, November 10th.  [Results are available](results/).
The tournament was held at the [Pinball Pirate](https://www.pinballpirate.com/) in Benicia.
