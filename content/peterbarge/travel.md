Airports
--------

Oakland and SFO airports are your best bets. SFO is likely better for those on
the east coast or who might want to spend some time exploring SF while
here. Oakland will be slightly more convenient.  SJC is OK, but it's a full
one-hour drive to Benicia even without traffic.

The venues are not close, so car rental is most convenient, but Lyft or Uber
are options as well. From Oakland, it's $50-75 to get to Pinole, and from
Pinole to Benicia is probably $40ish. It’s $75-100 from Benicia to the Oakland
airport. If there is demand for a ride or rideshare page, we can set one up.

Hotels
------

Staying near Pinole, Emeryville, or Benicia are likely your best bets. We do
not recommend staying near the Oakland Airport based on crime in that area. Bay
Area folks may be able to provide feedback on locations of lodging you may be
considering. While we don't have first hand experience with all of these
hotels, here are some possible options near Peter in Pinole, near Saturday
night dinner &amp; poker in Emeryville, or near the poker venue in Benicia:

### Near Pinole

Courtyard Richmond Berkeley in Richmond: several attendees stayed here in 2023.
It’s about 20 minutes from Emeryville and 20 minutes from Benica.  Stevan
Goldman and Deron Brod stayed there in 2024.

Days Inn in Pinole should be serviceable&mdash;nothing fancy.

Courtyard Marriott in San Pablo is a step up from the Days Inn.

Hotel Mac in Point Richmond is in a quaint neighborhood and will have historic charm if you want a place with personality.
(Sometimes, it is not a likeable personality.)

### Near Emeryville

Hyatt House Emeryville/SF Bay Area and Hyatt Place Emeryville/SF Bay Area are
both closest to the Saturday night dinner location and to the Oaks Card Club.

### Near Benicia

Holiday In Express is close to Pinball Pirate.  Patrick & Eileen Milligan
stayed there last time and will be staying there this time as well.

Union Hotel is also in a quaint neighborhood with historic charm and
personality. Some rooms will have water views.

Best Western will be your typical basic hotel room.

And of course, Airbnb may also provide options. If you coordinate with others,
it is possible renting a home may be a better way to go than a motel.
