PeterBARGE was held as a surprise for Peter Secor.  Peter lives in the Bay Area
and was unable to make BARGE in 2023.

Details on this event are a little thin because we had to keep it off the
[BARGE lists](https://www.barge.org/resources/mailing-lists/) so Peter wouldn't
know.

We met at the California Grand the night before, and a private game was held at
the Hotel Mac in Point Richmond that, reportedly, involved alcohol.

Ron Grossberg shared a video that captured the moment of Peter's surprise.
