PeterBARGE III will be held November 8-9, 2025.

[Townhouse](https://townhouseemeryville.com/) in Emeryville.  Dinner is $75 for
a prix fixe menu.  Details will be sent to those registered.
See their [website](https://townhouseemeryville.com/) or the location on 
[Google maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xrMtoJ4W5P8t8WLZ8).

We plan to congregate in one of the local cardrooms before and after.  [The
Oaks](https://www.oakscardclub.com/) is a short walk away.

On November 9, we will hold our private tournament at the [Pinball
Pirate](https://www.pinballpirate.com/) in Benicia. Doors will open at 10:00AM,
with breakfast sponsored by members of the Breakfast Club.  Cards in the air at
11:00AM.  The tournament is open to all members of the \*ARG\* community.

Registration is strongly encouraged, as we are space limited.

Our tournament is planned to end by 3:30PM, giving attendees a fighting chance
of catching a late flight home.

No fees are charged for the tournament.

Local [travel](../travel/) and [casino](../casinos/) advice is available.

Contact [Tim Showalter](mailto:tjs@psaux.com) with any questions.

We will accept donations to cover expenses for the tournament.  In the past,
this has covered signs, trophies, and pizza, and drinks.  Any overage will be
donated to World Central Kitchen.
