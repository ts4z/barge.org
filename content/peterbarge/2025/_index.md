PeterBARGE III was held November 8-9, 2025.

On Saturday night, we had dinner at the Townhouse in Emeryville.  Although we
had a prix fixe menu, they decided to just charge us for everything instead and
it came out substantially less!  We contributed the savings to the PeterBARGE
fund.

We held our tournament as scheduled at the Pinball Pirate shop in Benicia,
Buyin was $100, and we had 29 players for a prize pool of $2900.  Andrew Prock
took down first place for $1,045.  [Full results are availale.](results/)

Peter was unable to attend, but quite a folks went to visit him at his house.

We had a number of cancellations of out-of-town folks related to a government
shutdown.

Thanks to our donors, including Carol Kline Anderson, Michael Patterson,
Nancy Robertson, and a lot of folks who handed over cash.  Eileen Milligan acted as TD.

Thanks to Chris Kuntz for hosting us at the Pinball Pirate shop.

Thanks to the members of the Breakfast Club for sponsoring breakfast.
