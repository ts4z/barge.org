PeterBARGE III will be held November 8-9, 2025.

We plan to have a dinner on Saturday night (November 8) but details are not yet available.

We will hold our tournament on November 9.  Doors will open at 10:00AM with a
tournament at 11:00AM.  The tournament will be held at the [Pinball
Pirate](https://www.pinballpirate.com/) in Benicia, thanks to the courtesy of
Chiris Kuntz.  The event is open to members of the \*ARG\* community.
(Community is defined pretty broadly, but this is a private event.  Contact
[Tim Showalter](mailto:tjs@psaux.com) for details.)

[Travel](../travel/) and [Casino](../casinos/) advice is available.
