You're probably here for [the gallery](gallery/).

It is a tradition of BARGE that each Main Event winner wins a custom
chipset... that they have to design.  These chips are sold as sample sets as well
as made available to the BARGE community.

We've got images of each of the chip sets and a little bit of information on
them.

[The gallery](gallery/) starts in [1993](gallery/1993/) and ends in [2019](gallery/2019/).

Special thanks to Patrick Milligan for reaching out to many folks who were
able to share images of chips from their collections.  Patrick also re-scanned and
edited a lot of these to get the best quality images we could.

There is even more [BARGE memorabilia](../memorabilia/) that we will add in the future.

## History of BARGE Main Event Chips

### Pre-BCC Chips

Starting with [1993](gallery/1993), and through
[1999](gallery/1999), chips were produced by the Main Event winner.
For the first few events, the chipset was presented at BARGE, but starting
with [1997](gallery/1997), the winner started designing their own chips.

In 2000, the main event winner did not make the chips.  [Ken &#8220;QB&#8221;
Kubey](/tags/qb/) [made a set](gallery/2000-qb/) for distribution at
[BARGE 2000](../../barge/2000/). A few BARGErs formed the [BARGE Chip Committee](../../bcc/) which
produced the [2000 make-up set](gallery/2000/) which was available the
next year, and paired well with the [2001 set](gallery/2001/).

### BCC Chips

Starting from the [2001](gallery/2001/) BARGE, and retroactive to the
[2000](gallery/2000-bcc/) chipset, the [BARGE Chip Committee](../../bcc/) 
formed to ensure chipsets were produced every year. Input from the Main Event
winners varied from very active to none at all.

The BCC's last chipset was the [2019](gallery/2019/) chipset.
