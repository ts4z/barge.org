QUICK LINKS:  [the gallery](gallery/)

It is a tradition of BARGE that each Main Event winner wins a custom
chipset... that they "get to" design.  These chips are also sold as sample sets
in order to fund the trophy set, and also because the BARGE community likes
chops.

[The gallery](gallery/) starts in [1993](gallery/1993/) and ends in
[2025](gallery/2025/).  There is also a [gallery table of contents](toc/).
We've got images of each of the chip sets and a little bit of information on
their history.

Special thanks to Patrick Milligan for reaching out to many folks who were
able to share images of chips from their collections.  Patrick also re-scanned and
edited a lot of these to get the best quality images we could.

There is even more [BARGE memorabilia](../memorabilia/) that we will add in the future.

## History of BARGE Main Event Chips

### Pre-BCC Chips

Starting with [1993](gallery/1993), and through [1999](gallery/1999), chips
were produced by the Main Event winner.  For the first few events, the chipset
was presented at BARGE and designed by the previous year's winner, but starting
with [1997](gallery/1997), the winner started designing their set for
themselves.

In 2000, the main event winner did not make the chips.  [Ken &#8220;QB&#8221;
Kubey](/tags/qb/) [made a set](gallery/2000-qb/) for distribution at
[BARGE 2000](../../barge/2000/).

### BCC Chips

Starting from the [2001](gallery/2001/) BARGE, and retroactive to the
[2000](gallery/2000-bcc/) chipset, the [BARGE Chip Committee](bcc/) 
formed to ensure chipsets were produced every year. Input from the Main Event
winners varied from very active to none at all.

The BCC's last chipset was the [2019](gallery/2019/) chipset.

### Chips are coming back!

For [2025](gallery/2025/), chips have been made, including make-up sets for
[2020](gallery/2020/), 
[2021](gallery/2021/), and
[2023](gallery/2023/).

A few extra chip sets may be available.  Contact [Tim Showalter](tjs@psaux.com).
