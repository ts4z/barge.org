You're probably here for [the gallery](gallery/).

It is a tradition of BARGE that each Main Event winner wins a custom
chipset... that they have to design.  These chips are sold as sample sets as well
as made available to the BARGE community.

We've got images of each of the chip sets and a little bit of information on
them.

[The gallery](gallery/) starts in [1993](gallery/1993/) and ends in [2019](gallery/2019/).

Special thanks to Patrick Milligan for reaching out to many folks who were
able to share images of chips from their collections.  Patrick also re-scanned and
edited a lot of these to get the best quality images we could.

for the opportunity to dig through their archives.

There is even more [BARGE memorabilia](../memorabilia/) that we will add in the future.

Please [contact us](mailto:tim.showalter@gmail.com) if you have images or
corrections. We&#8217;re missing some Purple Chips, and probably others, and
there are many other things that have been made that we haven&#8217;t yet
collected images of.
