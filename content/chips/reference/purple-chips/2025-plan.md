title: Purple Chip Plan for 2025 and Make-up Sets
date: 2025-05-23
summary: New guidelines for purple chips.
---

In [2025](../../../gallery/2025/), we are reviving the chip tradition, including the limited-issue purple
chips.

We have found that purple chips have become a problem.  This includes trying to
find people who no longer attend BARGE, sometimes months or years after the
event, as well as associated costs with this.  This has become an entitlement
and chore, and the RBCC team was pretty unhappy with carrying that forward.  So
we are doing things differently.

Our goals here are pretty straightforward:

- We want to be effectively done distributing purple chips at the end of BARGE.
- We want to award chips to people who are still involved in BARGE,
  specifically, the people who *actually come to BARGE*.
- We do not want to give chips to people who are no longer involved or who no
  longer want chips.
- We don't want to produce excess purple chips.
- We want to make this easy on Organizers, future main event winners, and RBCC.

For 2025, our Purple Chip Plan is:

1. In order for someone to receive a purple chip for which they are otherwise
   entitled below, they must attend the BARGE.
   **The RBCC will not ship 2025 purple chips.**
2. The Previous Main Event Winner will be given discretionary chips.  They may
   do whatever they want with these, including (but not limited to) keeping
   them, or shipping them to people not otherwise eligible.  They may also buy
   extra purple chips.
3. No one else may buy purple chips from RBCC.
4. One purple chip is reserved for:
  - the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place winner in major events
  - the 1st place winner in second chance events
  - all Previous Main Event winners who attend BARGE
  - members of the chip production team (RBCC)
  - each Organizer
  - the Banquet Speaker
5. At most one purple chip will be given per person, excepting the Previous
   Main Event Winner.  Any second or further chip will be given to the Previous
   Main Event Winner as an additional discretionary chip.
6. 3 purple chips are reserved for the host
   room and given to the poker room manager for their distribution.
7. All chips not distributed by the end of BARGE will be forfeit.
   - Prize chips are intended to be awarded at the events.
   - Other chips (ME legacy winners, make-up set purple chips) should be collected
     before the start of the 2025 Main Event dinner break.  If not, these chips will
     be released to the Previous Main Event Winner as additional discretionary chips.
   - A Previous Main Event Winner who wants these additional discretionary
     chips should be sure to collect them on Saturday night.
8. In the event something crazy happens (BARGE is cancelled, postponed, moved
   online) RBCC will make reasonable efforts to uphold the spirit of these
   rules while ignoring the inconvenient parts.
9. History suggests we have been somewhat haphazard in giving out purple chips.
   This will likely continue.  Everyone involved is encouraged to obey the
   spirit of these rules, not the letter.

We are also distributing make-up chips for 2020, 2021, and 2023, since no chips
were available at these events. They are being given out at BARGE 2025.

* The same rules apply for who is eligible for chips, but not how they are
  distributed.  We are making a limited effort to get purple chips to event
  winners and previous main event winners.
* If you are entitield to chips, and you attend BARGE, we will have chips for
  you.
* For anyone who buys a sampler set and pays for shipping, we will mail
  purple chips with sampler sets.
* For anyone who does not buy a sampler set, please let us know how we can get
  you your chips.  We would prefer to minimize shipping costs.
* In any event, **make-up chips not claimed by the dinner break of BARGE 2025
  will be forfeit** and will be given to the pictured main event
  winner as additional discretionary chips.  We will try to make an exception
  for chips that are arranged to be picked up later, etc.

This plan may not necessarily apply to future purple chips at future BARGEs.
