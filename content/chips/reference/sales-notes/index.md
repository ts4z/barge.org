These notes are mostly by Tim.

Logistics
---------

In 2025, We sold chips with a Google form and the promise of Venmo payments.

If Tim had this to do over again, and couldn't find a proper shopping cart
system, he would have collected money directly, since it would have been easier
to audit.

Expected Sales
--------------

Chip volume has decreased.  In the 2025 batch, two winners did not "add on" to
their sample set.  The other two winners did buy bulk chips, but no one else did. 
Historically, we tend to sell about 1/3 as many chipsets as
main event entrants.  We did a little better than that, about 40%.

Budget
------

BCC chips historically made a small profit.  The accumulated carry-forward
profit doesn't do the community any good.  A small buffer and/or working
capital would be enough in Tim's opinion.

Historically, chip designs have benefited from the designer happening to have
an Illustrator license for some other reason.  This is not currently the case,
so art costs have increased.

Chip costs have increased.  While the chips are printed in the US, they likely
involve tariffed materials.

Accessories
-----------

Chip sets have always come with a case.  In 2025, we bought them from BRPro.

The BCC has historically provided a framed set of chips as a trophy.  Games &
Frames can cut their 20-chip frame to a 16-chip frame.
