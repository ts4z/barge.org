These notes are mostly by Tim.

Taking Orders
-------------

Chip sales have been handled by all sorts of means in the past.

In 2025, We sold chips with a Google form and the promise of Venmo payments.

If Tim had this to do over again, and couldn't find a proper shopping cart
system, he would have collected money himself, since it would have been easier
to audit.

Additionally, a Google Form makes a crappy shopping cart experience.  But it is
easy to set up.  However, several people sent the wrong amount of money in, etc.

Expected Sales
--------------

Chip volume has decreased.  Historically, we tend to sell about 1/3 as many chipsets as
main event entrants.  In 2025, we did a little better than that, about 40%, but
the main event is smaller than it used to be.

Additionally, "bulk" sales are very hit-and-miss.  In the 2025 batch, two
winners bought additional chips.  Two winners did not.  No one outside the
winners bought bulk chips.


Budget
------

BCC chips historically made a small profit.  The accumulated carry-forward
profit doesn't do the community any good.  A small buffer and/or working
capital would be enough in Tim's opinion.

Historically, chip designs have benefited from the designer happening to have
an Illustrator license for some other reason.  This is not currently the case,
so art costs have increased.

Chip costs have increased.  While the chips are printed in the US, they likely
involve tariffed materials.

I suggest making a proper budget and using that to set the chip set price.
The number of chips sold is somewhat predictable.

Pricing
-------

[Check out the 1993 announcement.](../../gallery/1993/original-announcement.txt)

In general, the markup on sample sets is intuitively kind of a lot.  We marked
the chips up about 150% after a lot of waffling.  We had a budget and did some
careful calculations, then at the last minute Tim bumped it up to make it
mostly a round $20 per sample set.  We believe we turned a small profit.


Accessories
-----------

Chip sets have always come with a case.  In 2025, we bought them from BRPro.

The BCC has historically provided a framed set of chips as a trophy.  Games &
Frames can cut their 20-chip frame to a 16-chip frame, the usual size of a
BARGE chip set.
