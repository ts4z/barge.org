Taking Orders
-------------

Chip sales have been handled by all sorts of means in the past.

In 2025, We sold chips with a Google form and the promise of Venmo payments.

If Tim had this to do over again, and couldn't find a proper shopping cart
system, he would have collected money himself, since it would have been easier
to audit.  Having another person (who happens to have the desirable handle
@bargechips) was confusing.

A Google Form makes a crappy shopping cart experience.  It is easy to set up.
However, several people sent the wrong amount of money in.

Expected Sales
--------------

Historically, we tend to sell about 1/3 as many chipsets as main event
entrants.  In 2025, we did a little better than that, about 40%, but the main
event is smaller than it used to be.

"Bulk" sales are very hit-and-miss.  In the 2025 batch, two winners bought
additional chips.  Two winners did not.  No one outside the winners bought bulk
chips.


Budget
------

BCC chips historically made a small profit.  The accumulated carry-forward
profit doesn't do the community any good.  A small buffer and/or working
capital would be enough in Tim's opinion.

It is very beneficial for the BCC if the chip designer happens to have
Illustrator, or access to a stock image service.  These things cost money.

Chip costs have increased.  While the chips are printed in the US, they likely
involve tariffed materials.

I suggest making a proper budget and using that to set the chip set price.
The number of chips sold is somewhat predictable.

Pricing
-------

[Check out the 1993 announcement.](../../gallery/1993/original-announcement.txt)

In general, the markup on sample sets is intuitively kind of a lot.  We marked
the chips up about 150% after a lot of waffling.  We had a budget and did some
careful calculations, then at the last minute Tim bumped it up to make it
mostly a round $20 per sample set.  We turned a modest profit.


Accessories
-----------

Chip sets have always come with a case.  In 2025, we bought them from BRPro.

The BCC has historically provided a framed set of chips as a trophy.  Games &
Frames can cut their 20-chip frame to a 16-chip frame, the usual size of a
BARGE chip set.  This worked well for 2025.
