During the time Patrick Milligan was the designer for BCC chips, he also worked
for a company called Home Poker Chips (HPC).  We have some of HPC's brochures
and reference material available below, reproduced here with their kind
permission.

HPC was using Chipco as a manufacturer. While Chipco&#8217;s product was
generally well-regarded, state and federal tax authorities had
[issues](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwood/2015/03/21/poker-chip-company-ceo-guilty-of-tax-evasion-paid-cash-now-faces-10-years/)
with their management.

The Chipco name is now held by a [new company](https://www.chipco.com/) that we
do not have experience with.

Many of the documents have specific comments that only apply to Chipco.
