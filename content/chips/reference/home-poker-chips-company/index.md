During the time Patrick Milligan was the designer for BCC chips, he also worked
for a company called Home Poker Chips (HPC). Home Poker Chips produced the chips for
BARGE. We have some of their brochures and reference material available below,
reproduced here with their kind permission.

HPC was using Chipco as a manufacturer. While Chipco&#8217;s product was
well-regarded, <a href=""> [state and federal tax authorities had
issues](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwood/2015/03/21/poker-chip-company-ceo-guilty-of-tax-evasion-paid-cash-now-faces-10-years/)
with their non-payment of taxes. The Chipco name is now held by a [new
company](https://www.chipco.com/) that we do not have experience with.

Many of the documents have specific comments that only apply to Chipco.
