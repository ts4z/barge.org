<p>During <a href="../../history/2001-2011/">the
time Patrick was the designer for BCC chips</a>, he also worked for Home Poker
Chips. Home Poker Chips produced the chips for BARGE. We have some of their
brochures and reference material available below.</p>

<p>HPC was using Chipco as a manufacturer. While Chipco&#8217;s product was
well-regarded, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwood/2015/03/21/poker-chip-company-ceo-guilty-of-tax-evasion-paid-cash-now-faces-10-years/">state
and federal tax authorities had issues</a> with their non-payment of taxes. The
Chipco name is now held by a <a href="https://www.chipco.com/">new company</a>
we do not have experience with.</p>

<p>Many of the documents have specific comments that only apply to Chipco.  </p>
