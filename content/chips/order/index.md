We're pleased to announce that the Reformed BARGE Chip Committee (BCC2.0) is
making sets for BARGE 2025, as well as make-up sets for 2020, 2021, and 2023.

[Orders are now open at this link.](https://forms.gle/PMWvMKGpmuCfXC7F7)
Ordering will be open through June 1.  At that time, we will place the order
with our vendor, and expect to have chips ready in time for [BARGE
2025](/barge/2025/).

## [2025 Chips](../gallery/2025/)

Tim's chips are nuts. There are 9 chips in this sample set.

### Squirrel Violet Chip

In celebration of the return of chips, and thinking of the original 1993 special purple chip, Tim is buying a "violet" chip for each entrant of the main event to be given out at the main event.  So no purple chips will be included with sample sets, but you can buy them in bulk if you want.

## [2023 Chips](../gallery/2023/)

{{< figure src="sampleset_barge_2023.png" link="../gallery/2023/" caption="8 chips in sample set" >}}

Jesse's chips feature a variety of ducks ready for a variety of holidays. There are 8 chips in the sample set.

## [2021 Chips](../gallery/2021/)

## Order Form

[Please place your order here.](https://forms.gle/PMWvMKGpmuCfXC7F7)

Note that:

1. All sales final once ordering is closed.  We are using money from orders to buy chips. We can't give your money back once we send it to the vendor.
2. All chips must be pre-ordered and pre-paid. While we plan to deliver them at BARGE, we can't sell them there.

If you need to cancel or change an order, please let us know while orders are still open.

## FAQ

### Why do the 2025 chips cost more?

9-chip set.

### Are the purple chips part of the chipsets?

No, by tradition, they're given out as prizes.  (For purposes of this
tradition, the 2025 squirrel chip is violet.)

### Why do the 2023 and 2025 chips have denominations?

Jesse and Tim wanted denominations.  Tim uses poker chips for board games, and
some board game players couldn't handle un-denominated chips.

### What about 2022 and 2024 sets?

Maybe next year.

### What about the BCC Fund?

The BCC had a nest egg from many years of sales of BARGE chips, which the Board and the Organizers have kept safe, and we have been given access to. We are using this to fund this batch of chips. We intend to break even.

### What about bulk sales?

If you want to buy enough chips make a "bulk" set for you to, say, play poker with, we are happy to do so!

In order to buy "bulk" chips, you must buy a sample set for the corresponding year, and you must buy at least 20 chips in any color that you want to order in bulk.

Start by submitting an order for the corresponding sample set, and email
[Tim](mailto:tim.showalter@gmail.com?subject=[BARGECHIPS]) with the details of
your bulk order.

Pricing will be dependent on sales of sample sets.

### What chips are available from previous years?

The BCC had a stockpile of back years for sale. We plan to have an inventory of
these soon and will make them available again.

However, do *not* count on 2020, 2021, 2023, or 2025 being available in the
future. Old chips do not sell well, so we will not be ordering extra sets.  Get
them now while you can.
