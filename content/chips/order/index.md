We're pleased to announce that the Reformed BARGE Chip Committee (BCC2.0) is
making sets for BARGE 2025, as well as make-up sets for 2020, 2021, and 2023.

[Orders are now open at this link.](https://forms.gle/PMWvMKGpmuCfXC7F7)
Ordering will be open through June 1.  At that time, we will place the order
with our vendor, and expect to have chips ready in time for [BARGE
2025](/barge/2025/).

As is tradition, all of the sets have a special purple chip
with the previous main event winner's picture.  These chips are not available
as part of the sample set.
(These are not pictured below but they are in the Gallery pages.)

## Order Form

[Please place your order here.](https://forms.gle/PMWvMKGpmuCfXC7F7)

Note that:

1. All sales final once ordering is closed.  We are using money from orders to buy chips. We can't give your money back once we send it to the vendor.
2. All chips must be pre-ordered and pre-paid. While we plan to deliver them at BARGE, we can't sell them there.

If you need to cancel or change an order, please let us know while orders are still open.

## FAQ

### I'm not planning to attend BARGE. Can I still get chips?

Sure!  We will ship for $15 (or $25 if you buy more than 6 sets).

### Why the markup?

Chip sample set sales pay for the trophy sets for the main event winner, plus
special purple chips for many other BARGErs.

### Why do the 2025 chips cost more?

10-chip set.

### Are the purple chips part of the chipsets?

No, by tradition, they're given out as prizes, and a few are given to the
winner on the chip.  (Many of the sets have a "violet" chip.  The purple chips
have the main event winner on them.)

### Why do the 2023 and 2025 chips have denominations?

Jesse and Tim wanted denominations.  Tim uses poker chips for board games, and
has found some board game players can't handle un-denominated chips.  (See also
[Tim's trip report](/blog/trip-reports/ts4z/2024-barge/).)

### What about 2022 and 2024 sets?

Maybe next year.

### What about the BCC Fund?

The BCC had a nest egg from many years of sales of BARGE chips, which the Board and the Organizers have kept safe, and we have been given access to. We are using this to fund this batch of chips. We intend to break even.

### What about bulk sales?

If you want to buy enough chips make a "bulk" set for you to, say, play poker with, we are happy to do so!

We ask that you first buy a sample set for the corresponding year, and you buy
a minimum of 20 chips in any color that you want to order in bulk.

Start by submitting an order for the corresponding sample set, and email
[Tim](mailto:tim.showalter@gmail.com?subject=[BARGECHIPS]) with the details of
your bulk order.

Pricing will be dependent on sales of sample sets.

### What chips are available from previous years?

The BCC had a stockpile of back years for sale. We plan to have an inventory of
these soon and will make them available again.

However, do *not* count on 2020, 2021, 2023, or 2025 being available in the
future. Old chips do not sell well, so we will not be ordering many extra sets,
if any.  Get them now while you can.

### Who is doing this?

This page is on barge.org as a courtesy to the Reformed BARGE Chip Committee (BCC2.0), an ad-hoc and ill-defined group which is making chips. This is not an "official" activity of BARGE, Inc., or the Organizers.

Members of BCC2.0 may include 
Doug Grismore,
Bruce Kramer,
Kevin Un,
Patrick Milligan,
Scott Harker,
and
Tim Showalter.

### Whose fault is this?

If anything goes wrong, blame [Tim](mailto:tim.showalter@gmail.com?subject=[BARGECHIPS]).
