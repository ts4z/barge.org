These chips were produced as giveaways to invite more people to come to BARGE.

These were made in addition to the usual tournament set.

Ron Grossberg came up with the concept of a BARGE Welcome chip shortly after
the end of BARGE 2016.  These are something that BARGErs could hand out, like a
business card, to folks that might be interested in attending future BARGEs.
The design effort was a collaboration between the [BARGE Chip
Committee](../../bcc) and the [BARGE Welcoming
Committee](/resources/barge-welcoming-committee/).

Michael McBride managed the design for the BARGE Chip Committee.  The chip
designer was Michael Brennan.  The final design had the BARGE logo on one side
and a Hold'em board with Presto! (5♥5♠) rivering the nuts against A♥A♠, 2♦2♥,
7♣7♠, and 7♦2♣ with a board of 7♥ 2♠ 5♦ A♣ 5♣.

Both red and black chips were designed.  A total of 2000 chips were ordered
(1000 red and 1000 black), paid for out of the BARGE fund.  At BARGE 2017,
everyone attending received a bag of ten chips (five red, five black).
