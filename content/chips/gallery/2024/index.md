Rich “ADB Omaholic” Bremer is the second BARGE main event winner to claim the
title for a second time.  Unlike [Russ](../2002/) (../2021/Fox), Rich earned
his second win in a live tournament.

Rich's 2012 chip set featured [Omaholic's 8 (or better) Steps To Achieving True
BARGE Enlightenment](../2012/).

He has a great idea for his second set that we hope to see real soon now.  For
now, we’ve included a protype of a possible purple chip as a placeholder.
