The 2025 chip theme, chosen by 2024 winner Tim Showalter, is "Nuts".  The
reverse sides of the chips depict a variety of nuts, more or less.

The chipset has two purple chips.  A light purple (squirrel) chip will be given
to all BARGE main event entrants, compliments of Tim.  This chip will not be
part of the sample sets (you already got one, right?), but it will be sold
separately.

This is the second chip, chronologically, with denominations (the first is
[2023](../2023)), something BARGE chips have traditionally eschewed, at Tim's
belligerent, tiresome insistence.

The edge design is intended to stack up making a repeating nut pattern. [^tell1]
This was inspired by the [2019 chip set](../2019/).

The common obverse side depicts a pinball bumper cap that also appears on Tim's
cash game set, which Patrick also designed some years ago.

[^tell1]: See [*Caro's Book of Poker
    Tells*](https://books.google.com/books?id=CNJDAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false),
    tell \#1, "I like to play with blocks."

Chip design and infinite patience by Patrick Milligan.  Thanks to Bruce, Doug,
and Tim's home game for many chip reviews.

  levellers on the finer pinball machines.  Picture by Chris Kuntz.

* white: A pina colada in an ADB coconut.  This chip features an "aligned"
  edge spot. No denomination, as ADBs are without number (that is, nobody
  remembers how many there are).
