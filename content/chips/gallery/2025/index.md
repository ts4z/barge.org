The 2025 chip theme, chosen by 2024 Main Event winner Tim Showalter, is "Nuts".
The reverse sides of the chips depict a variety of nuts, more or less. <!--more-->

This is the second chipset with denominations.  The first was [2023](../2023).
BARGE chips have traditionally eschewed them.  They were included at Tim's
belligerent, tiresome insistence.

The edge design, stacked neatly, makes a repeating nut pattern.  (See [*Caro's
Book of Poker
Tells*](https://books.google.com/books?id=CNJDAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false),
tell \#1, "When I was a boy, I liked to play with blocks.")  This was inspired by the [2019 chip
set](../2019/).

The common obverse side depicts a pinball bumper cap that also appears on Tim's
cash game set, which Patrick also designed some years ago.

Chip design and infinite patience by Patrick Milligan.  Thanks to Doug
Grismore, Bruce Kramer, and Tim's home game for many chip reviews.

  barge-relpol list.
* Green 25: Jordan almonds.
* Black 100: ⅝" nuts with a ⅜-16 thread, the correct nut for locking down leg
  levellers on the finer pinball machines.  Picture by Chris Kuntz.

* White: A pina colada in an ADB coconut.  This chip features an "aligned"
  edge spot. No denomination, as ADBs are without number (that is, nobody
  remembers how many there are).
