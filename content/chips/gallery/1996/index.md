This set was designed by Tom Sims. A 300 chip home set of these chips was
presented to the 1996 BARGE NLHE Champ, Mike Zimmers.

There were some issues with this chipset, which [Tom would periodically
enumerate on rec.gambling.poker](/blog/chipco-manifesto/).

Chip images provided from the collection of Tom Sims.
