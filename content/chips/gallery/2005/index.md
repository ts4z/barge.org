This year, the theme is Las Vegas Neon. Each chip in the chip set has a common
obverse (BARGE XV and the Canadian or Maple Leaf Presto!) with a different Las
Vegas neon sign for each face. Standard chip colors are used.

## Development Notes

The BCC came up with the Neon design on its own, among a few other concepts.
Patrick Milligan found a couple of those artifacts: [Canadian
coins](bcc_01.pdf) and [Names of Hands](bcc_02.pdf).
