All chips in the **2001: A Poker Odyssey** set have a common obverse (Buzz
Aldrin holding Presto) with a different scene for each face featuring a space
scene and a &#8220;Prestolith&#8221; (our version of a monolith). Notice also
that there are 2 forms of the Prestolith.

## Development Notes

Much consideration was given to switching back to [Chipco
International](https://www.pressherald.com/2015/05/29/president-of-closed-falmouth-poker-chip-company-sentenced-for-tax-evasion/)
for these chips.  Patrick sent [this
message](possible-change-of-chip-vendors.pdf) to interested parties with a link
to [this image](Chip_Vendors.jpg) as to how chips would change from the
original Paul-son design.

Patrick found a larger image of the [Prestolith](PrestoScape.jpg) used in the
background of these chips in his archives.
