Our 2020 chips were designed by 2019 Main Event winner Scott "Scottro" Harker
with help from Patrick Milligan and Michael Brennan.

Scott's chips were not produced until the [2025 batch](/tags/2025-batch/), but
Scott had a design in mind dating back to 2020.  From his comments about these
chips (heavily edited):

> My theme was just me. I wanted two palm trees, each one bending inward, and a
> pair of 7s rising like the sun in the background.  The WOW and the bee are
> personal.  It's more of a desert sunrise.

> I am obsessed with palm trees, so I wanted to have them on my chips. I love
> the desert sunset and I wanted to incorporate the sevens in there to replace
> the sun, with rays of light behind them. [...]  I wanted to keep the common
> reverse classic BARGE, so I incorporated some ideas from past sets. I really
> like the sunburst design from the 2005 chips[.]

The purple chip is a little different:

> One is me winning the main, the other is a pic of Monte Christensen.  I
> promised to dedicate one chip to him, and I decided I wanted to do that with
> the purple chip.
