This year, the theme is &#8220;Poker Archetypes.&#8221; Each chip in the chip set has a common obverse showing the scales of justice weighing Presto! against Aces. Standard chip colors are used. The BARGE 2009 NLHE Champion, David &#8220;Heldar&#8221; Heller, came up with the theme.

In David&#8217;s opinion, the poker world has three types of players: Donkey/Hosers, Pokermaticians, and Lawyers.

The Donkey/Hosers are those who call a preflop raise with 72o and then flop a full house.

The Pokermaticians are those who play the game by game-theoretic, pareto-optimized, non-exploitable strategies.

The Lawyers are those who play by reading people and situations.

This year&#8217;s chip set pays homage to each of these types of poker player,
showcasing archetypes of each category, and also illustrating a difference
between the Lawyer&#8217;s bluff and the Pokermatician&#8217;s bluff: Lawyers
bluff by telling a convincing story (not necessarily in words); Pokermaticians
bluff according to an equation, using an appropriate randomizer. (Donkey/Hosers
never bluff because they have flopped the nuts anyway).
