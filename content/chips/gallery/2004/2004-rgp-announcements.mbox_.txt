In keeping with the tradition that whoever lucks out
and wins the BARGE NLHE tourney must be an ace chip set
designer, I invite you to peruse this years set. I hope
you like them:

Much thanks to Patrick Milligan for doing all the hard
work, and to the BCC for their inspiration, advice, and
support with the practical matters of order processing
and distribution.

Paul Person

As was posted earlier this week, this years Barge Collectors chips are
available for sale. We are a little late this year and production is expected
to take a little longer due to pokers explosion onto the public radar.
 
Order page:
http://www.pokerart.com/barge/2004/chips/order.asp
 
The pre-order price of $14 is offered through May 30, 2004. After that
deadline, the chip set price will go up and bulk orders will no longer be
available. ALL CHECKS SENT MUST BE POSTMARKED BY MAY 31th TO GUARANTEE THE
ABOVE PRICES.
 
Thanks
Randy Collack

 Thanks for the memory.
13 short years of BARGE
r00lerz  at SARGE and MARGE
for ESCARGOT, more so FARGO
for chatfriendz who are ATLARGE
We thank you so much.


   And Now Thanks to 2003 BARGE NLHE Champ Paul "sunfish" Pearson and the,
toil
day till dawn workaholics of the BCC you will never need to rely on a fading
blurred memory of Prestos and Barges past or present again.  Simply advance
purchase your 2004 BARGE chips set at the soon to be forgotten low price of
$14.00 each. Then you can let your hazy post BARGE nostalgia laden orbs
reflect lovingly upon your own 2004 BARGE chip sets and all those delightful
BARGE Memories will come streaming back once more. Streaming back again not
unlike like the first rays of dawn after a all night must straddle 4/8
chowaha game.

   You and your friends couldn't  be more excited with an ADBer  calling for
"cocktails" in the must drink CHORSE game than you will be with this one of
a kind chipset. Chip Castles will be built and returned from whence they
came before Chip Sets like these will ever be created again. In fact these
chips were created under the watchful eye of Jesus himself.  I have no Doubt
these collectors grade chipsets will with time age like a fine memory or a
fine liqueur only becoming better and savored with greater intensity with
the passage of the years.  Take advantage of this years short advanced
sales period and buy numerous sets to Save, Trade or Roshambo over, whether
it be
with a pile of fish or one of your friendly BARGE organizers.

  so goto http://www.pokerart.com/barge/2004/chips/info_ss.asp and order
yours
today at the incomprehensible low advance purchase price of just $14.00 per
set.

  Fulfill your fantasy of owning your own limited edition BARGE 2004 home
poker chip set at our bulk order page

 BCC-timmer
