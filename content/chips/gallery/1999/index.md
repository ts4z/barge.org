This set was created by Lee Jones, the 1998 NLHE winner. The fish photographs
were acquired from [Norbert Wu Productions](http://www.norbertwu.com/). They
include a clownfish, three different angelfish, a moray eel, an oceanic
whitetip shark, and a humpback whale. The whale is on the special purple
chip. The common obverse shows an &#8220;Art Deco&#8221; style magician
presenting aces. The Presto! codeword is hidden on the magician&#8217;s collar.

Chip images provided from the collection of Tom Sims.
