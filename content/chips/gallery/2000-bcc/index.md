The chips in the&nbsp; **2000: The Year of RGP** &nbsp;set celebrate two RGPers
winning major poker tournaments.&nbsp;Spencer &#8220;Zorak&#8221; Sun&nbsp;won
the 2000 Tournament of Champions at the
[Orleans Hotel &amp; Casino](http://www.orleanscasino.com/)
in Las Vegas, Nevada.&nbsp;Chris
&#8220;Jesus&#8221; Ferguson&nbsp;won the No-Limit Hold&#8217;em championship
in the 2000 World Series of Poker at&nbsp;
[Binion&#8217;s Horeshoe](http://www.binions.com/)
in
Las Vegas, Nevada.

All 8 chips have a common obverse. There are 4 chips with Chris and 4 chips with Spencer on the face.

### Development Notes

This is the first chip produced by the BARGE Chip Committee, and was actually produced in 2001.
Only [QB's 2000 chips](../2000-qb/) were actually available at BARGE in 2000.

The [2001](../2001/) chips were produced at the same time, so the [2001 development
notes](../2001/#development-notes) discussion of changes to the chip vendor
applied to these as well.
