This year, the theme is "IRC Poker." Each chip in the chip set has
a common obverse with a different r00lbot saying on the reverse
("tails") side. Standard chip colors are used.

The r00lbot sayings used are:

*  "Man this game just keeps getting better."
*  "Bet more win more!"
*  "ATM is -----&gt; that way."
*  "Call this if you don't like money."
*  "I didn't hear what you said. Busy stacking chips."
*  "It's about time the cards started to recognize the talent!"
*  "BUHWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!"
*  "If you re-raise me I might fold."
