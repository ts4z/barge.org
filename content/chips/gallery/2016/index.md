From the 2016 message that announced the sampler sets were available:

> The 2016 set was designed by 2015 BARGE Main Event Champion Jennifer Shahade
> who also happens to be a two-time American Women&#8217;s Chess Champion. This
> chess set is also available in 34 pieces so you have a complete chess set.

Due to some design delays, these chips were actually produced at the same time
as the [2017 chips](../2017/).
