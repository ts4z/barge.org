This set was created by Ken Kubey, using the artwork from the BARGE 2000 lapel
pin. When it became clear that there would be no BARGE 2000 chips coming from
the 1999 NLHE Champ [John Harkness](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2190393/), Ken
bought some cheap plastic poker chips and applied stickers to make up this
set. Some argue that this limited edition set is the &#8220;official&#8221;
BARGE 2000 chip set, and [the BCC set](../2000-bcc) is the &#8220;make
up&#8221; set.
