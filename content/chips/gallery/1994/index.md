This set was designed by Roy Hashimoto. A 300 chip home set of these chips was
presented to the 1994 BARGE NLHE Champ, Dave Hughes.

There were four chips sold in the sample set: blue, red, green, and black.
Purple chips were given out for special reasons.  We also have a white chip
pictured below, but this wasn't part of the original set.  In 2025, Roy told us
this:

> Your white BARGE 1994 chip is a bit of a mystery. [...]
> There was someone who ordered a full usable set of several hundred

We eventually figured out that someone ordered a large set of chips with whites
instead of blues and sometimes gave away a white chip.

These chips also look suspiciously like the cover of [Winning Low Limit
Hold'em](https://www.amazon.com/Winning-Low-Limit-Holdem-Lee-Jones/dp/1886070237)
by [Lee Jones](../1999/).  (Lee doesn't know where the art came from, and the
edge spots are not the same.)
