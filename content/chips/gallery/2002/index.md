These chips were created by BARGE 2001 NLHE Champion Russell Fox, with the
graphic design help of Patrick Milligan and the support and feedback of the
BARGE Chip Committee. All chips in the&nbsp;**Rocks**&nbsp;set
have a common obverse (the &#8220;Welcome to Fabulous BARGE&#8221; sign) with a
different &#8220;rock&#8221; sample for each face. The colors used are the
standard &#8220;Southern California&#8221; set.

This was the original appearance of what became the BARGE logo.  The X in XII
is subtly split into two Vs, putting Presto on every chip.

Russ won the main event again in [2020](../../../barge/2020/), and so was the first one to get [a second chip set](../2021/).
