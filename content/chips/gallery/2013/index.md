From the announcement for the 2013 chips:

> This year’s set, designed by 2012 Champ Paul McMullin, and created by Michael
> Brennan commemorates truly unlikely events. How else can you explain a
> victory by Paul other than Pigs must be Flying? What next?
>
> Nolan getting religion?
>
> QB finding some gamble?
>
> Interstellar ARG events?
>
> Elvis playing Barge?
>
> Foldem drinking nonalcoholic beverages?
>
> Scottro accepting a deal? (really…like he could ever get that close)
>
> JP losing a blackjack count?
>
> Patti up early for CHORSE?

(Despite the diss in the announcement, Scottro did win the Main Event in
2019––and did not make a deal. He didn&#8217;t make his chips, though.)
