Russ Fox was the first BARGEr to win the Main Event twice.  However,
his second win was in 2020 when the event was held online.  Because of this,
his win merits an Asterisk.

This, Russ' second set, highlights major sporting events that merit an
Asterisk.  His first chip set, back in [2002](../2002/), used the theme of
“Rocks”.

Russ provided these explanations for the images on his chips:

[Roger Maris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Maris) hit 61 home runs in
1961 to set the record, but it was in a 162-game season when the previous
record was set in a 156-game season; the record had an
[asterisk](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0250934/).

[Josh Gibson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Gibson) hit 84 home runs in
one year in the Negro leagues (1936).

The Chicago Bears won the [1932 NFL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1932_NFL_season) Championship. [The
game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1932_NFL_Playoff_Game) was moved indoors to
old [Chicago Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Stadium)
and played on a 60-yard field. (It deserves two asterisks:
one for that, and one for being the first indoors official NFL game.)

The [1968 Mexico City Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_Summer_Olympics) were the scene of all sorts of records because of the altitude ([Mexico City](https://mexicocity.cdmx.gob.mx/) is at 7,349 ft).

On June 23, 1917, [Babe Ruth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babe_Ruth) (then a pitcher with the 
[Boston Red Sox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox)) started a game against the 
[Washington Senators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Senators_(1901%E2%80%931960)) at 
[Fenway Park](https://www.mlb.com/redsox/ballpark). He walked the first batter
([Ray Morgan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Morgan)), argued with the home plate umpire, and was ejected.
[Ernie Shore](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/shoreer01.shtml) replaced him. Morgan tried to steal second, was thrown out. Shore proceeded to pitch [a perfect game...but for only 26 batters](https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-charlotte-observer-ernie-shore-relie/Ken/).

[Ken Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Johnson_(right-handed_pitcher))
of the Houston Colt 45s (which became the [Houston
Astros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros#1962%E2%80%931964:_The_Colt_.45s))
no hit the Cincinnati Reds but lost 1-0 on April 23, 1964; he was the first
pitcher to pitch a nine inning no-hitter and lose.

[Wayne Gretzky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Gretzky) scored 894 goals
in the [National Hockey
League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League)…but also had 46
in the [World Hockey
Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Hockey_Association) that don’t
count. In the years between the design of the 2021 chips and their production,
[Alex Ovechkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Ovechkin) took
Gretzky's NHL record--and, surprisingly, his place on the orange chip as
well. As of today, the overall (asterisked) record is still held by Wayne
Gretzky.
