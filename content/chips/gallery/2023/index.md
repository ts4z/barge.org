Jessie Capps, 2022 Main Event winner, has had a fondness for Rubber Ducks for
some time.  He often brings them to the tournament poker table.  It seems like
a good idea for a theme for his chips.

This set was designed by Patrick Milligan with input from Jesse.
This set includes ducks for Independence Day, Valentineâ€™s Day, Christmas,
Thanksgiving, Easter, Mardi Gras, Halloween, and Summer Vacation.

Chronologically, these are the first BARGE chips to feature denominations
(although they are being as part of the [2025 batch](/tags/2025-batch/)).
