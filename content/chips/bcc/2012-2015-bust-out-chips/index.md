In 2012, the BCC again wanted to have new bust-out chips.  Oversize chips
were also no longer available for home use, so 39mm chips were produced.

These chips were produced by 
[Chipco International]({{< relref chipco-manifesto >}}),
who produced the [2012 chipset](../../gallery/2012/).

These chips were designed by Patrick Milligan.
