TARGET History
--------------

Founded in 1994.  Ken Kubey's idea.  Named by Lee Jones.  The Annual
Rec.Gambling Entry Tournament (TARGET) is the 2nd oldest live RG event.
I had heard about the WSOP as early as 1975.  I never thought that
I would put up $10,000 myself, but I *did* think that someday
I could play in a tournament with all of my friends and we could send
one player into the WSOP.  Little did I know...

The original idea was to win $1010 and play in a single table satellite
to get into the $10,000 WSOP Championship.  We also gave the TARGET winner
the option of playing in super satellites.  Rob Fagen came very close
to winning a seat in a super.  J.P. Massar also came close in a single
table satellite.

In 1998, we decided to up the prize money to allow the winners of TARGET
to directly enter a $2000 or $2500 WSOP event.  Jack McClelland was
the tournament director for TARGET in 1998.

In 1999 and 2000 we held TARGET at the Sahara with Keith Bronson
as the tournament director.

In 2001 through 2005, TARGET was held at the Mirage with Richard White
as the tournament director.

There was no TARGET event in 2006 due to the WSOP being
so close to BARGE.

In 2007 and 2008 we were back at the Mirage with Chris Dozen as the TD.

In 2009, Ernest Webber was the TD.

In 2010, Mark Gershoff was the TD.

There was no TARGET event in 2011.

In 2012, Mark Gershoff was the TD.

In 2013, Kevan Garrett took over as temporary TARGET organizer.
TARGET was held at Binion's.

In 2014 we were back at the Mirage with Mark Gershoff as the TD.

There was no TARGET event in 2015.

In 2016 we were back at the Mirage with Mark Gershoff as the TD.

In 2017, Kevan again ran TARGET at the Mirage.

In 2018, Kubey was back to run TARGET.


Barbara Garrett became the first TARGET winner to cash in a WSOP
event with TARGET funds.  She won $3888 in a 2007 $1500 NLH event and
returned $583 to the TARGET group.  We each got $20 back.
The remainder was rolled into the 2008 prize pool.

Ken Kubey followed up Barbara's success by making the money
in a 2009 $1500 NLH event.  Kubey cashed for $2988 and returned $448
to the TARGET group.  Players again got $20 back with the remainder
going to charity.  Several players sent their shares to charity
and some told Kubey to keep the $20.  Thanks guys.

Ken Kubey again cashed in a $1000 NLH event in 2010 for $2847
returning $427 to the TARGET group.  Players got $21 back.
Again several players sent their shares to charity and
some told Kubey to keep the $21.  Thanks again.

Dan Goldman (playing for Sharon Goldman) added $500 of his own money
to play in a $1500 event in 2013.  Team Goldman cashed for $2778 and
returned $278 to the TARGET group.   Players got back $25 each.

Kevan Garrett played in the Seniors event in 2016 and had his first
WSOP cash for $1615.  Players got back $10 each from Kevan.

Bill Chen played in a $10,000 LHE event in 2016 adding $9000 of his own
money.  TARGET had 1.5% of Bill.  He cashed for $49,304. Players
got back $30 each from Bill.

Corey Imsdahl played in the Seniors event in 2017 and finished in 527th
place for $1993.  Players got back $19(rounded to $20) from Corey.

Paul Stine played in the Seniors event in 2018 and finished in 154th
place for $4344.  Players got back $30 from Paul.

Though the satellites have pretty much gone the way of the VHS tape,
TARGET has spawned its own group of satellite tournament where
players put up $30 or $40 to try to win their way into TARGET.
There was even a $6 entry satellite to one of those satellites.
Imagine running $6 into $10,000,000 :-)
