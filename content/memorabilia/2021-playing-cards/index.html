<p>In 2021, Tim Showalter and John &#8220;JZK&#8221; Scheinberg made decks to
give away. Usually you just do the backs, which we got Patrick Milligan to do
for us; but since the vendor had the ugliest card faces I've ever seen, we did
our own. The card faces are standard (yet technically custom, because we did
both sides), but I was really happy with the ladybug joker.  Plus, with the
extra joker, each deck has 55 cards!</p>

<p>The ladybug joker and ace of spades art were done by <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/apexinfinityg">Irene Adam</a>.</p>

<p>Patrick Milligan did the card layout, the BARGE logo joker, and the Horseshoe joker. (The Horseshoe isn&#8217;t upside down; it&#8217;s the way it was depicted on Binion&#8217;s Horseshoe, the longtime home of BARGE.)</p>
