The current rulebook is here:

* [Current Rulebook as Web Page](/rulebook/)
* [Current Rulebook as PDF](/rulebook.pdf) Note that this has to be manually updated, so this
  may be slightly out of date.

The current rulebook is maintained via the scripts and source here:

* https://github.com/ts4z/barge-rulebook/

We also have a collection of the old rulebooks here:

* https://secure.barge.org/bargerulebooks/

Before we had a PDF rulebook, we had a website that was a source for the book.
