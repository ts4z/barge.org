Steve Daniel has put together a points database for all the years that BAAP
points have been tracked. I believe the spreadsheet includes all *ARG results
going back to 2003. On the Lists tab you can generate reports of total
points/cashes/money won, which can be filtered by year and/or game type. You
can also generate reports of total finishes for any paying place (i.e., 1st,
8th, 17th, etc.) (also filterable by year and/or game type).

You can [download the database
here](https://irp.cdn-website.com/7fa840da/files/uploaded/All_ARGE_All_Years_BAAP_Results_through_BARGE_2024.xlsm)
or you can just click on the link below. The current database is
updated through BARGE 2024 and will be periodically updated.  Enjoy!
