These chips were created by BARGE 2002 NLHE Champion Mike &#8220;Howler&#8221;
McBride, with the graphic design help of Patrick Milligan and the support and
feedback of the [BARGE Chip Committee](../../bcc).

All chips have a common obverse (a photographic version of the &#8220;Welcome
to Fabulous BARGE&#8221; sign) with a different example of&nbsp;**Presto! in
Art and History**for each face. Standard chips colors are used.
