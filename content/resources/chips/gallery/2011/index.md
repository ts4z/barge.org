This year, the theme is &#8220;Reindeer Games.&#8221; Each chip in the chip set
has a common obverse showing a reindeer in a sleigh being pulled by a set of
cards. Standard chip colors are used. The BARGE 2010 NLHE Champion, Chuck
Humphrey, came up with the theme.

This year&#8217;s chip set pays homage to the wide variety of poker games that
are played during BARGE. &nbsp;Saturday night after the banquet is the prime
time to sign up for these games, but they are often in play throughout BARGE
week.
