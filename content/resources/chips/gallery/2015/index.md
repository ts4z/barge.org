From the 2015 annoucement for the sampler sets:

> In everyone’s life there is a first time. The 2014 BARGE Main Event winner,
> Andreas &#8220;Andy&#8221; Wolfram, was inspired by his first time in Las
> Vegas and made the BARGE Virgin Experience his 2015 BARGE Chip Collection
> theme. Ron invited Andy to BARGE. Artist Mike McBride captured the iconic
> moment featuring Ron in a dress ensuring Ron remains a virgin forever at
> least in Andy’s mind. Andy had a fabulous sushi dinner represented by the
> tuna roll chip. Other fun virgin activities include playing the Sex in the
> City slots with a group of traveling positive EV nuns who were staying at the
> Queens, drinking Shirley Temple’s while other players were downing shots of
> tequila, trying to find the Virgo constellation while under the laser show in
> downtown Vegas, and finally losing his shirt while on the very funny craps
> tour across multiple casinos. We invite you to share Andy’s BARGE Virgin
> Experience by purchasing your own sampler set of the 2015 BARGE Chip
> Collection.
