This set was designed by Roy Hashimoto. A 300 chip home set of these chips was presented to the 1994 BARGE NLHE Champ, Dave Hughes.

We don&#8217;t have pictures of other chips in this design, but we have seen a white chip with triple edge spots. There may be others.

Chip images provided from the collection of Tom Sims.
