This year, the theme is &#8220;IRC Poker.&#8221; Each chip in the chip set has a common obverse with a different r00lbot saying on the reverse (&#8220;tails&#8221;) side. Standard chip colors are used.

The r00lbot sayings used are:

* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Man this game just keeps getting better.&#8221;
* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Bet more win more!&#8221;
* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;ATM is &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;&gt; that way.&#8221;
* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Call this if you don&#8217;t like money.&#8221;
* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;I didn&#8217;t hear what you said.&nbsp; Busy stacking chips.&#8221;
* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;It&#8217;s about time the cards started to recognize the talent!&#8221;
* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;BUHWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!&#8221;
* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;If you re-raise me I might fold.&#8221;
