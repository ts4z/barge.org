## Introducing the 2018 BARGE Chips

This was a tough year. The head designer of the BARGE Chip Committee had to
veto Chris&#8217;s first two suggestions of Non-mastery of Music (Sitar,
Key-tar, bagpipes, concertina, moog, didgeridoo, theremin, kazzo and Tibetan
throat singing) and a full checkers set of just two chips &#8211; red and
black. Thankfully, the ghost of Tom Bayes spoke to Chris in a dream or a bar
(he is not sure which) and inspired his theme of &#8220;The Poker
Curriculum&#8221; &#8211; coming to a university lecture hall near you soon!
