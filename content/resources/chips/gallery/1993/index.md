This was the very first BARGE chip set, created by Steve Jacobs. A 300 chip
home set of these chips was presented to the 1993 BARGE NLHE Champ, Roy
Hashimoto. Each attendee at BARGE 1993 also received a purple chip.

A few of the chips came in the form of refrigerator magnets or on key
chains. In addition, Michael &#8220;kidZee&#8221; Zimmers used the artwork to
produce decks of 
[playing cards](https://www.bargechips.org/other-stuff/1993-playing-cards/).

After BARGE was over, Steve Jacobs predicited: &#8220;Sorry to say I
don&#8217;t think any more BARGE chips will ever be made. They were simply too
much trouble.&#8221; Good thing he was&nbsp; *wrong*!
