These chips were created by BARGE 2001 NLHE Champion Russell Fox, with the
graphic design help of Patrick Milligan and the support and feedback of the
BARGE Chip Committee. All chips in the&nbsp;**Rocks**&nbsp;set
have a common obverse (the &#8220;Welcome to Fabulous BARGE&#8221; sign) with a
different &#8220;rock&#8221; sample for each face. The colors used are the
standard &#8220;Southern California&#8221; set.
