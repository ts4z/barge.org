Starting with [1993](../../gallery/1993), and through
[1999](../../gallery/1999), chips were produced by the Main Event winner.
For the first few events, the chipset was presented at BARGE, but starting
with [1997](../../gallery/1997), the winner started designing their own chips.

In 2000, the main event winner did not make the chips.  Ken &#8220;QB&#8221;
Kubey [made a set](../../gallery/2000-qb) for distribution at
BARGE 2000. A few BARGErs formed the [BARGE Chip Committee](../../bcc) which
produced the [2000 make-up set](../../gallery/2000) which was available the
next year, and paired well with the [2001 set](../../gallery/2001).
