In 2000, the main event winner did not make the chips.  Ken &#8220;QB&#8221;
Kubey [made a set](../../gallery/2000-qb) made aset> for distribution at
BARGE 2000. A few BARGErs formed the [BARGE Chip Committee](../../bcc) which
produced the [2000 make-up set](../../gallery/2000) which was available the
next year, and paired well with the [2001 set](../../gallery/2001).
