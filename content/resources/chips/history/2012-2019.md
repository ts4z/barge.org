The usual vendor for chips changed from
[Chipco](https://www.pressherald.com/2015/05/29/president-of-closed-falmouth-poker-chip-company-sentenced-for-tax-evasion/)
to [BR Pro Poker](https://brpropoker.com/).

The members of the BCC continued to evolve.  David Lawful took over as Chairman
somewhere during this time.
