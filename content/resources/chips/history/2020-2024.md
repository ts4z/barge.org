A lot of things didn’t happen in 2020. For instance, for several months, you
were not allowed to have fun in Las Vegas, or pretty much anywhere else. BARGE
even happened virtually. Unfortunately, the loss of momentum meant chips didn’t
happen for the 2019 main event winner — and things continued in that direction
through 2024.

In late 2024, Patrick Milligan and Tim Showalter started reconstructing a gallery
of all of the chips, and then realized we could just put it on barge.org.
