A lot of things didn’t happen in 2020. For instance, for several months, you
were not allowed to have fun in Las Vegas, or pretty much anywhere else. BARGE
even happened virtually. Unfortunately, the loss of momentum meant chips didn’t
happen for the 2019 main event winner — and things continued in that direction
through 2024.

In late 2024, Patrick Milligan and Tim Showalter started putting all the chips
on a site, initally reviving [bargechips.org](https://bargechips.org/) for this
purpose, and then migrating that content here.

We also have a [salvaged copy of the old pokerart.com
site](https://pokerart.bargechips.org/). Some of the links may work better
there. (If you discover any links offering to sell you anything there, note
that they no longer work.)
