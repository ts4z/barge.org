Starting from the 2001 BARGE, and retroactive to the 2000 chipset, the [BARGE
Chip Committee](../../bcc/) was formed to ensure chipsets were produced every year. Input
from the Main Event winners varied from very active to none at all. Starting
with 2012, Michael Brennan was the lead designer.

In March 2001, the [BCC](../../bcc/) was formed. At that time, it appeared that the BARGE
2000 NLHE champion was unlikely to participate in the creation of BARGE chips,
so a group of RGPers took the reigns and formed the BCC. The founding members
were Randy Collack, Scott Harker, Andy Hughes, David Lawful, Patrick Milligan,
Tom Sims and Paul Stine.

The BCC mission in 2001 was to get the process back on track and to make sure
that a set of BARGE chips is produced every year, with or without participation
from the current NLHE champion. They created, marketed, and distributed the
chips sets for 2000 and 2001.

Tom Sims left the BCC shortly after the initial chip designs were completed in
late April 2001. During his short time as a member, he provided the perspective
on how the BARGE chips were made in the early years. He was replaced by Tim
Stine as a member.

Russell Fox and Mike "Howler" McBride joined the BCC after helping to make
their chip sets.
