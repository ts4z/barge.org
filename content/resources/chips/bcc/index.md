For twenty [BARGE](/) events,
the BARGE Chip Committee ensured there were commemorative chips available for
attendees, and that the winner of the Main Event got a chip set to take home
for their home game. This page discusses that history.  This information was
taken from an archive of the [PokerArt.com](https://pokerart.bargechips.org)
site and has been aggressively abridged.

The BCC was one of the more consistent parts of BARGE, and predates the
founding of [BARGE, Inc.](/inc), the 501(c)(7) corporation that organizes our
fun.

It appeared that the BARGE 2000 NLHE champion was unlikely to participate in
the creation of BARGE chips, so a group of RGPers took the reigns and formed
the BCC in March of 2001.  The founding members were Randy Collack, Scott
Harker, Andy Hughes, David Lawful, Patrick Milligan, Tom Sims and Paul Stine.
The BCC ensured that chip sets were produced consistently from 2001 until 2019.

The BCC mission in 2001 was to get the process back on track and to make
sure that a set of BARGE chips is produced every year, with or without
participation from the current NLHE champion. They created, marketed, and
distributed the chips sets for 2000 and 2001.

Tom Sims left the BCC shortly after the initial chip designs were completed
in late April 2001. During his short time as a member, he provided the
perspective on how the BARGE chips were made in the early years. 

Tim Stine joined the BCC.  Russell Fox (2001 and 2020 champ), and Mike
&#8220;Howler&#8221; McBride (2002 champ) joined the BCC after winning their
(first) main events.  Patrick stepped down as designer after 2011 and was
succeded by Michael Brennan.

David Lawful succeeded Randy Collack as chairman.

In 2020, due to a variety of factors, the BCC no longer produced chip sets,
and the BCC effectively disbanded.
