title: BARGE Chip Committee

For twenty [BARGE](/) events,
the BARGE Chip Committee ensured there were commemorative chips available for
attendees, and that the winner of the Main Event got a chip set to take home
for their home game. This page discusses that history.

The BCC was one of the more consistent parts of BARGE, and predates the
founding of [BARGE, Inc.](/inc), the 501(c)(7) corporation that organizes our
fun.

More details of the BCC are available on the [2001-2011](../history/2001-2011/) and 
[2012-2019](../history/2012-2019) history pages.
