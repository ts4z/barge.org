You're probably here for the  [the gallery](gallery/).

It is a tradition of BARGE that each Main Event winner wins a custom
chipset... that they have to design.  These chips are sold as sample sets as well
as made available to the BARGE community.

We've got images of each of the chip sets and a little bit of information on
them.

Then we realized we already *had* a web site, so we moved it all here.
Please excuse the dust.

If you're brave, [start with the gallery](gallery/)!

There is even more [BARGE paraphernalia](../paraphernalia/) that we will add in the future. 

Please [contact us](mailto:tim.showalter@gmail.com) if you have images or
corrections. We&#8217;re missing some Purple Chips, and probably others, and
there are many other things that have been made that we haven&#8217;t yet
collected images of.
