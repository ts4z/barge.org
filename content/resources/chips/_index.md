It is a tradition of BARGE that each Main Event winner wins a custom
chipset... that they have to design.  These chips are sold as sample sets as well
as made available to the BARGE community.

We've got images of each of the chip sets and a little bit of information on
them.

We even built a web site to collect it all. See [bargechips.org](https://www.bargechips.org).

Then we realized we already *had* a web site.  So we're migrating the content
here, but we're not done yet.  Because of this, this section is pretty well
mangled.  You might want to peruse bargechips.org for now.

If you're brave, [start with the gallery](gallery/)!

There is other BARGE paraphernalia that we will add in the future. Feel free
to <a href="mailto:tim.showalter@gmail.com">contact us</a> if you have images
or corrections. We&#8217;re missing some Purple Chips, and probably others, and there are
many other things that have been made that we haven&#8217;t yet collected
images of.
