At this time, there is no formal Code of Conduct, but at a minimum it is
expected that all who participate in our tournaments and other activities
will observe the rules of our host poker room, be respectful of all poker
staff and players, and not be openly critical of other players. Abuse of
staff or other players will NOT be tolerated. Bad beats happen. Players get
lucky. Dominated hands lose. Deal with it. Our goal is to create a pleasant
experience for all participants.
