The BARGE Welcoming Committee is a informal group of BARGErs who help
first-time attendees (read: Virgins) get acclimated, meet people and just
generally have a great time!  They can be identified by some sort of special
thingy on their name badges - but most likely, they'll find you if you don't
find them!
 
Here are some articles written by members of the BARGE Welcoming Committee:

 * [What I Wish I'd Known](/blog/what-i-wish-id-known)
 * [How Not to Feel Like an Outsider](/blog/how-not-to-feel-like-an-outsider)
