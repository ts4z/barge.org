<!-- This could use some work.  Hugo has better facilities for a glossary, and
  there's a lot of opportunity to add flavor that we're missing out on
  here. -->

<p>This document contains terms and definitions common to the BARGE (Big August
  Rec.Gambling Excursion) event. If you attend BARGE or join one of the BARGE
  mailing lists, you might hear some of these words and phrases. If you consult
  this guide, you might actually find out what they mean. You might also be
  confused since some of these definitions contain something we like to call
  irony.</p>

<p>Please provide suggestions for additions to this document.</p>

  <dd>alt.drunken.bastards, a USENET newsgroup that epitomizes the philosophy

  the three components of the group title are actually required to be granted
  membership.</dd>

  <dt>Binglaha</dt>
  <dd>An Omaha poker variant popular at BARGE. It is played exactly as pot-limit
    Omaha, except that after the flop betting a single die is rolled (typically by
    the player on the button.) If the result of the roll is a 1, 2, or 3, the game
    is played high-low split eight-or-better. If the roll is 4, 5, or 6, the game
    is played high-only. The person originally responsible for this monstrosity is
    Don &ldquo;ADB Bingo&rdquo; Rieck.

  <dt>calcutta</dt>
  <dd>Calcutta? You must be mistaken. That would be wrong. In other contexts a
    Calcutta refers to a wagering pool on the outcome of some other event,
    something especially common in the backgammon world. At BARGE, something like
    this would be unsanctioned wagering, and we wouldn't want any of that, now
    would we? You might be looking for the symposium.</dd>
  
  <dt>C-HORSE</dt>
  <dd>6-game rotation team tournament. C is Crazy Pineapple.</dd>
 
  <dt>Canadian Presto</dt>
  <dd>If Presto is pocket fives, then given the current exchange rate, Canadian
  presto would be pocket fours. Similar to the old joke about pocket queens
  being called Canadian rockets. Canadian exchange rate jokes are always
  funny.</dd>
  
  <dt>CCR</dt>
  <dd><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card_roulette">Credit Card
      Roulette.</a>  Among BARGErs, this is invariably played for the drama, with
    players selecting cards that "lose" until one player "wins", i.e., pays the
    check.  Sometimes played with a last longer: Each player puts in $5, which
    goes to the last loser.  For extra fun, try playing <em>before</em> you
    order dessert.
  </dd>
 
  <dt>chat friend (abbreviated as CF)</dt> <dd><ol>
      <li>Friend from the Internet. Originally referred to IRC, but these days is likely to be mistaken to refer to a more modern real-time messaging protocol.
      <li> More often than not, this term would be used ironically by someone who is imitating an Internet newbie from a point in history where there was such a thing. An example would be saying quite loudly, &ldquo;Will you be my chat friend?!&rdquo;
      <li>  Another BARGEr who you knew well through IRC poker (&ldquo;JK?  Yeah, he's a chat friend from way back in the day.&rdquo;)
  </ol></dd>
  
  <dt>Chic'd</dt>
  <dd>The act of being drawn out on in a game of chance by a player who is
    believed to be of inferior skill but wins despite taking unwarranted
    risks. Some don't consider it being chic'd unless the winner also displays an
    inappropriate amount of glee over the victory.  This term is named for
    Charles &ldquo;Chic&rdquo; Natkins.  Usage: &ldquo;He chic'd me when he
    called and won the hand with king deuce after I first moved in on him and
    then showed him my pocket kings.&rdquo;</dd>
 
  <dt>chip castle</dt>
  <dd>Like a sand castle, except more valuable because it's made out of casino
  chips that can typically be redeemed for currency. Some poker players make
  fairly elaborate constructions out of their chip stacks. Most of the people
  who think they do this but have never been to BARGE are pikers.</dd>
 
  <dt>Chop (or Chop it up)</dt>
  <dd>Split a pot, prize, expense, etc.</dd>

  <dt>Chop-Chop</dt>
  <dd>Split the pot between two players, usually heard in split-pot games such as Omaha/8 or Stud/8.</dd>
  
  <dt>Chowaha</dt>
  <dd>A poker game frequently dealt at BARGE. &ldquo;Casino Chowaha&rdquo;
    differs from &ldquo;real&rdquo; Chowaha, a game invented by BARGEr Mike
    Chow. We can't imagine how it got its name. In casino Chowaha, everyone gets
    two cards, followed by a round of betting. Then there are three flops
    (forming a square of nine cards), followed by two turn cards (placed to the
    right of the flops, in between rows 1 &amp; 2, and rows 2 &amp; 3,
    respectively), followed by one river card (placed to the right of and between
    the two turn cards.) Each player makes the best five card hand out of both of
    their two down cards and three out of each possible five board cards. Note:
    If one is playing the top row of the flop, then one cannot play the bottom
    turn card. Similarly, if one is playing the bottom flop, then one must play
    the bottom turn card. In Casino Chowaha, the pot is awarded to the high
    hand.
    [<a href="/rulebook/chowaha.html">rulebook</a>]
    Real Chowaha is often played high/low split, and is typically played
    with four cards per hand.</dd>
  
  <dt>Craps Crawl</dt>
  <dd>Annual tradition at BARGE whereby a group of inebriated BARGErs start at
    one end of Fremont street playing craps wildly and drinking wildly working
    their way through a variety of casinos. Betting the &ldquo;dark side&rdquo; is
    allowed, and betting the dark side and spiking the ball when the dice show
    &ldquo;7&rdquo; is grudgingly tolerated.</dd>
  
  <dt>dark side</dt>
  <dd><ol>
      <li>Betting the &ldquo;don't pass&rdquo; and &ldquo;don't come&rdquo; in craps. This is as opposed to a right side bet.</li>
      <li>Nolan Dalla's ADB nickname.</li>
  </ol></dd>
  <dt>DC</dt>

  <dt>Death March</dt>
  <dd>Annual BARGE golf outing, traditionally held very early in the morning (6:00AM) by badly hung-over participants.</dd>
    
  <dt>ding</dt><dd>The sound that occurs in one's head when a fortune smiles on such a person allowing them to win in a situation where victory had previously seemed unlikely.</dd>

  <dt>ESCARGOT</dt>
  <dd>
    Extraordinary Southern California Rec.Gambling OuTing.  (I admit I'm not
    sure what the T stood for.)  A former ARG event held at the Bicycle Club in
    Bell Gardens.  (This event hasn't happened in many years.)
  </dd>
  
  <dt>Fun Run</dt>
  <dd>2 to 3 mile group run/walk during BARGE</dd>
  
  <dt>gamb000l!</dt><dd>A battle cry for someone who plans to engage (enthusiastically) in some contest of chance. Can be used as a verb, as in the grammatically problematic, &ldquo;I gamb00l you!&rdquo; The number of &ldquo;0&rdquo;s is variable, but at least two is required and more suggests greater emphasis. Can be abbreviated &ldquo;gambo&rdquo;.</dd>

  <dt>gg</dt><dd>Short for "good game", often heard on
    <a href="https://craftpoker.com">craftpoker.com</a>,
    as well as the rest of the Internet.
  </dd>

  <dt>ggfn</dt><dd>Short for "good game for now".  Often heard
    on <a href="https://craftpoker.com">craftpoker.com</a> for a
    player who busted out during a re-entry period who is expected
    to be back after a brief re-entry.
  </dd>

  <dt>Golden R00ler</dt><dd>A virtual trophy (and on occasion, an actual trophy) given as an award to the person who least exemplifies the spirit of BARGE for the year prior to a given BARGE event. The inaugural recipient was Ernie E in 1998. See also r00ler.</dd>
  
  <dt>&ldquo;Go For Goldie&rdquo; (or just Goldie) bets</dt>
  <dd>An offer of a last longer bet by Stevan &ldquo;Goldie&rdquo; Goldman against
    the field in the BARGE NL hold'em tournament. This is the reincarnation of the
    infamous &ldquo;Quick bet&rdquo;.</dd>

  <dt>Good</dt>
  <dd>(adj.) a poker hand that wins</dd>

  <dt>Goot</dt>
  <dd>(adj.) a poker hand that wins (chat speak)</dd>

  <dt>gumbo</dt>
  <dd>The Texas hold'em starting hand of 85, properly called &ldquo;Nacogdoches gumbo&rdquo;. Nacogdoches gumbo does not have to but may be suited. The hand was one of many named by Tyler Wong, but this is pretty much the only one anybody remembers.</dd>

  <dt>HORSE</dt>

      <dt>S</dt><dd>Stud</dd>
      <dt>E</dt><dd>Stud Hi-Lo Eight-or-better</dd>
    </dl>
    That the HORSESHOE had HORSE and SHOE games in the WSOP is,
    certainly, a complete coincidence.
  </dd>

  <dt>Horse</dt>
  <dd>A player you have a piece of in a tournament</dd>

  <dt>IFSATG</dt>
  <dd>I F***ing Suck at this Game! (also: nick of Steven Carbonara)</dd>
  
  <dt>IGHN</dt>
  <dd>Abbreviation for, &ldquo;I go home now.&rdquo; A phrase one utters when one has just been forced out of a gambling situation due to lack of money or chips.</dd>
  
  <dt>IRC</dt>
  <dd>Abbr. for &ldquo;Internet Relay Chat&rdquo;.  IRC had a channel which was an
    online poker server.  The IRC poker server, with many homes over the years,
    dealt 23-handed NL.  A popular graphical interface to the IRC poker server was
    written by Greg &ldquo;FeltShark&rdquo; Reynolds.  The players set the parameters
    (blinds, minutes per level) for each tournament, with the winner of the
    previous tournament doing the setting. Cliff &ldquo;Deadhead&rdquo; Matthews was
    known for &ldquo;quitting&rdquo; a tournament if he got heads up to avoid setting
    the parameters.  Many ARGrs first met in cyber-space on this server, including
    Greg &ldquo;Fossilman&rdquo; Raymer and Chris &ldquo;Jesus&rdquo; Ferguson.</dd>
  
  <dt>Irwin?</dt>
  <dd>If someone announces &ldquo;Presto!&rdquo; at a gambling table, this is what you ask them to determine if they're really BARGErs. The correct BARGE counter-counter-sign is, &ldquo;Actually, no.&rdquo;</dd>

  <dt>jerj</dt>
  <dd>Jerk, as in a person whose behavior is unsocial. The origin is a post made to rec.gambling.poker, where the writer in referring to Phil Hellmuth, mispelled the work &ldquo;jerk&rdquo;.  It has been added to the Urban Dictionary with a similar definition.</dd>
  
  <dt>jopke</dt>
  <dd>A misspelling by Phil Hellmuth of the word &ldquo;joke&rdquo;.  Generally credited to Phil Hellmuth, when he was posting from a mobile device very quickly.</dd>
  
  <dt>Last Longer</dt>
  <dd>A bet between two players or groups on who will bust out last</dd>
  
  <dt>mass barring</dt>
  <dd>Some casinos have been truly paranoid about blackjack card counters, some
    to the point of being so aggressive that players without an advantage of any
    sort have been frequently barred. Starting in 1993 [ I think ], and running
    through 1996 [ maybe ] an unofficial BARGE event was for a bunch of card
    counters would descend on one of these casinos, and get backed off. Hijinks
    ensued. One of these trips is chronicled in the book Knock-Out Blackjack, by
    Vancura and Fuchs.</dd>
  
  <dt>Mixed game</dt>
  <dd>Table where many different poker games will be played</dd>

  <dt>Monday Night Tournaments</dt>
  <dd>
    BARGE typically conducts more unusual tournaments earlier in the week.
    In recent years, the Monday tournament is generally the most unusual,
    and a large percentage of the prize pool is also donated to charity.
    See also the entry for Tuesday Night Tournaments.
  </dd>

  <dt>must drink</dt>
  <dd>A poker game in which sober players are not welcome. The &ldquo;must&rdquo;
    terminology comes from the familiar &ldquo;must move&rdquo; type of poker
    game. Often at BARGE a &ldquo;must drink, must straddle, must toke, must not
    move HORSEL (HORSE + California lowball)&rdquo; game will break out.</dd>

  <dt>must move</dt>
  <dd>
    Many poker rooms use a device called "must move" when starting poker
    games. Their concern is that if they are aggressive in starting a second
    table of a running game, and the second game isn't strong enough to stay
    filled or nearly filled, it may not only break, but jeopardize the first
    game as well. Additionally, players in the first game may want to play in
    the second game, and their interest in playing at each table may depend on
    who is moving and who isn't. This can lead to upset players and
    considerable down time.  Consequently, a casino may choose to start a
    second game as a "must move" game, where new players join the second game,
    but as seats open in the first game, they are replaced by players in the
    second game in the same order in which they joined the second game. This
    ensures that the first game remains full, and the second game will last as
    long as there is sufficient interest. Often times, a casino will make a
    game "must move" for some period of time, and then if it's stable, make
    them equal games, allowing freer movement between them.
  </dd>

  <dt>must not move</dt>
  <dd>
    In 1997, in order to avoid breaking a full 4-8 HORSE game, Binion's
    Horseshoe made that game "must not move" as a condition for starting a 2-4
    Chowaha game. That is, the HORSE players were not allowed (actually, asked
    to consent) to not joining the Chowaha game.
  </dd>

  <dt>must straddle</dt>
  <dd>A poker game in which straddles are required.  Something of a parody of
    "must move" games.  This is not so uncommon in cash games these days in
    which players are experimenting with an extra blind; however, BARGE has
    been doing it for decades in some of the wilder limit games.
  </dd>
  
  <dt>Nick</dt>
  <dd>Nickname.  This is a technical term and a holdover from IRC days.</dd>
  
  <dt>No Good</dt>
  <dd>(adj.) a poker hand that loses</dd>
  
  <dt>No Goot</dt>
  <dd>(adj.) a poker hand that loses (chat speak)</dd>

  <dt>non-smoking smoker</dt>
  <dd>A smoker is a dinner where one is encouraged to celebrate the end of a fine meal with a cigar, a tradition at early BARGEs and ATLARGEs. Some who might have liked to participate in such an event are non-smokers, so they created their own &ldquo;rival&rdquo; event. As of December 8, 2006, restaurants in Nevada do not permit smoking, so the original &ldquo;smoker&rdquo; no longer exists.</dd>
  
  <dt>North Shore</dt>
  <dd>The verb form of pussy, as in, &ldquo;I heard Scottro was coming to BARGE this year.&rdquo; &ldquo;Naw, he north shored at the last minute, again.&rdquo; Named for Mike &ldquo;ADB North Shore&rdquo; McManus.</dd>
  
  <dt>OFC</dt>
  <dd>Open-face Chinese Poker</dd>
  
  <dt>On Tilt</dt>
  <dd>Upset, angry, steamed (usually from poker)</dd>
  
  <dt>Over/Under</dt>
  <dd>Usually a bet proposed where a person sets a line, and takes opinions as to whether the result will be over or under that line. A popular type of a bet at dinner gatherings of BARGErs, where the amount of the dinner check is bet on.  An even more popular version of this bet is when Nolan offers to set the line and serve as the house, then has everyone bet the over and he gets crushed.</dd>
  
  <dt>pocker</dt> <dd>A gambling game of skill played with cards. Some would spell it &ldquo;poker&rdquo;. Those people aren't true r00lerz.</dd>

  <dt>presto</dt> <dd>A two-card hold'em hand consisting of pocket fives. The ultimate hand of magical significance among BARGErs. Loosely, it can also refer to any hand that includes two fives. The first telling of the story has been chronicled on rec.gambling.</dd>
  
  <dt>Quick bet</dt> <dd>Dave &ldquo;Quick&rdquo; Horwitz would offer a last-longer bet against the entire tournament field of the NL hold'em event, called a &ldquo;Quick bet&rdquo;.  Dave was the first person to bust out of the NL tournament one year at BARGE. Lately, this challenge has been taken up by Stevan &ldquo;Goldie&rdquo; Goldman with his Go for Goldie bets.</dd>
  
  <dt>R</dt>
  <dd>Abbreviation for "Rigged", particularly
    on <a href="https://craftpoker.com">craftpoker.com</a>.  Always meant in jest, yet
    the pain of losing is always real.
  </dd>
  
  <dt>rai</dt> <dd>An abbreviation of the commonly used poker term &ldquo;raise&rdquo;. Must be said emphatically. A proper response to a player who says, &ldquo;Rai!&rdquo; can either be &ldquo;Re-rai!&rdquo; or &ldquo;Re-re-rai!&rdquo;  Another proper response to &ldquo;Rai!&rdquo; is &ldquo;You rai??  I re-rai!!&rdquo;.</dd>
  
  <dt>Rec.Gambler</dt>
  <dd>Pronounced: rec dot gambler. Someone in our group.</dd>

  <dt>rec.gambling</dt>
  <dd>The original newsgroup that spawned the BARGE name.  When the Internet
  was young, a conversation started here that begat BARGE.</dd>

  <dt>rec.gambling.poker</dt>
  <dd>aka RGP.  The other newsgroup that nurtured BARGE.  rec.gambling was
    split apart.  rec.gambling.blackjack and rec.gambling.poker were most
    relevant for BARGE, for obvious reasons.</dd>

  <dt>Reindeer Games</dt>
  <dd>Wild poker games Saturday Night at BARGE.</dd>
  
  <dt>RGP</dt> <dd>An abbreviation for the USENET newsgroup rec.gambling.poker.</dd>
  
  <dt>right side</dt> <dd>A bet with the shooter at a craps table, as opposed to the dark side.</dd>
  
  <dt>rocks n' beer</dt>
  <dd>This term comes from a BARGE in the 1990's, where the Luxor ran a daily
    tournament.  When a large group of BARGErs went there to play, and were
    subsequently refused entry due to the locals complaining because we didn't
    keep the noise level down, a strategy was devised to punish the Luxor for
    their evil behavior.
    <br><br>
    At one point in Las Vegas history, it was possible to find poker games,
    usually 7 card stud, where there were no antes and the bring-in was
    provided by the winner of the previous pot.  This means that if you never
    play a hand, there's no way the game can cost you any money.  You can sit
    there all day, never play a hand (playing like a rock), and accumulate
    complementary cocktails (or beer).  In fact, a group of people could sit
    at a table, never play hands, and drink a lot. If these people took care
    of the dealers and the cocktail servers, it's possible that no one would
    ever complain - and the casino would make absolutely NO money (and in
    fact, lose money on the free beverages).
    <br><br>
    This game has entered BARGE legend.  I have found some evidence that it
    was actually at the MGM at BARGE in 1995.
  </dd>

  <dt>r00ler</dt>
  <dd>Someone who &ldquo;rules&rdquo; at gambling. On occasion, this can be used
    ironically. Can also be used as a gerundive (r00ling) or a verb (to
    r00l). The proper plural is &ldquo;r00lerz&rdquo;.  One who has been beaten
    badly in poker is said to have been &ldquo;r00led&rdquo;.  Similarly, one who
    has beaten someone badly has also &ldquo;r00led&rdquo;.</dd>
  
  <dt>saddenz</dt>
  <dd>What one says when something unfortunate happens. If &ldquo;saddenz&rdquo;
    just doesn't cut it, one could always invoke &ldquo;mega saddenz&rdquo;, as in,
    &ldquo;I can't go to BARGE this year. Mega saddenz.&rdquo;</dd>
  
  <dt>Save</dt>
  <dd>Deal to give the person who finishes one away from the money a prize
    (usually their initial buyin or slightly more or less).  See also Scottro
    save.</dd>
  
  <dt>Scoop</dt>
  <dd>Win the whole pot in a split pot game</dd>
 
  <dt>Scottro</dt>
  <dd><ol><li>The namesake Texas hold'em hand consisting of pocket sevens.<li>Scott Harker.</ol></dd>

  <dt>Scottro save</dt>
  <dd>In a poker tournament, there is always someone who is the last person to
    bust out who receives no money. This phenomenon is commonly called busting
    out &ldquo;on the bubble&rdquo;. As the bubble position approaches, the game
    often slows down, going hand for hand on all tables until someone busts out,
    leaving all remaining players &ldquo;in the money&rdquo;.
    <br><br>
    In some tournaments the players agree to set aside some money for
    the bubble player both to ease the pain of the bubble and also to remove
    the necessity of going hand for hand and slowing down play. The name is
    ironic, as Scottro is famous for categorically rejecting all tournament
    poker deals of any sort.

  <dt>symposium</dt><dd>BARGE event whereby BARGErs sit around and ostensibly
    debate matters of great importance to society rather than perform any
    unsanctioned gambling, such as bidding on players to win the annual
    no-limit hold'em tournament in a format commonly called a
    &ldquo;Calcutta&rdquo; in other settings. If you go, you might want to bring
    a pile of money, though, just in case some sort of opportunity comes up.
    (The symposium has run virtually since 2022.)
  </dd>

  <dt>TARGET</dt>
  <dd>
    <a href="/target/">TARGET</a> is a poker tournament that is a sort of
    gentlemen's super-satellite. The buy-in has historically been in the
    $150-$200 range. Typically 20-30 people participant. The prize pool is
    broken up into $1500 chunks. The top places win this amount, and are
    expected to take their winnings and use it to buy in to a World Series of
    Poker event of their choosing, with 15% of their winnings divided up among
    the other TARGET participants.

  <dt>Team CHORSE</dt>
  <dd>A tournament-like competition between teams of six players each playing
    one of the games that comprise CHORSE in rotation. (These days, teams/games
    are split so that multiple members from each team are in action at the same
    time). CHORSE consists of limit Crazy pineapple, Hold'em, Omaha high/low
    split, Razz, 7-card Stud, 7-card stud high/low Eight-or-better. </dd>

  <dt>Tuesday Night Tournaments</dt>
  <dd>
    BARGE typically conducts more unusual tournaments earlier in the week.
    In 2000, this started with a "History of Poker" tournament on Thursday.
    But by 2004, this tournament had worked its way back to Tuesday.
    See the entry for Monday Night Tournaments.

  <dt>World Roshambo Championships</dt>
  <dd>A &ldquo;rock, scissors, paper&rdquo; tournament typically held after the
  banquet each year. Since no casino is involved, it would be improper to
  gamble for money, so the tournament is just for fun. The cost to enter
  traditionally is 100 units of fun.</dd>

  <dd>Abbreviation for, &ldquo;You go home now.&rdquo; Said to an opponent you have just decisively r00led.</dd>

  <dt>&ldquo;(insert first name), you're not going to like this...&rdquo;</dt>
  <dd>Originally said at an ATLARGE in the Nineties where ADB Jaeger (Eric
    Holtman) hit his one-outer against Nolan Dalla.  It has become a sentence
    that you might especially say to Nolan, or some other player when something
    is about to happen that he won't like, such as getting beat by a brutal
    suck-out on the river, again. Can also be applied to another r00ler by
    substituting their name for Nolan's, although statistically it's much more
    likely that something will happen that Nolan won't like than that such an
    event will happen to another person.</dd>
