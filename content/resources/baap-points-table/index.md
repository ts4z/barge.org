Per Stephen &quot;Crunch&quot; Daniel, the creator of the BAAP (BARGE All-Around Player) calculation, otherwise known as &quot;Crunchy&quot; points:

There is a lot of interest by a few people in being able to know where they
have to finish in the final few event of an ARGE event and/or a specific
tournament to win either the event or the over all BAAP top spot.  The attached
spreadsheet show how many points will be won for finishing in Nth place in a
tournament with M players.  The table can be adjusted for number of people
qualifying for points by cashing, saves and deals included.  You can change
both the % paid and the extra beyond the percent.

The spreadsheet can be downloaded by clicking on the link.
