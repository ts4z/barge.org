## [BARGE-announce](https://groups.google.com/a/barge.org/g/barge-announce)

Everyone interested in **BARGE** or **EMBARGO** should subscribe to this list.

This list for major BARGE announcements, such as registration opening and
closing, etc. This is a low volume moderated list.

[Subscribe here.](https://groups.google.com/a/barge.org/g/barge-announce)

## [BARGE](https://groups.google.com/a/barge.org/g/barge)

This list is for general discussions about BARGE, BARGE members,
topics peripheral to the lives of BARGE members, stray thoughts that randomly
occur to BARGE members...on any subject except religion and politics.
This list is decidedly not low volume, and subscribers may be exposed
to strongly held opinions with which they do not agree. You have been
warned. While this is a very open list, there are guidelines by which we expect
all participants to abide.  **EMBARGO** announcements are also made here.

[Subscribe here.](https://groups.google.com/a/barge.org/g/barge)

## [BARGE-RelPol](https://groups.google.com/a/barge.org/g/barge-relpol)

**BARGE-RelPol** was added for those die-hard BARGE members that find
themselves drifting more and more into esoteric or passionate debate about
decidedly non-BARGE general topic areas like religion or politics. This is
lower volume than the main BARGE list above, but is even more likely to expose
you to those strongly held opinions we refer to above.  While this is a very
open list, there are guidelines by which we expect all participants to abide.

## Other non-BARGE Events

There are also separate mailing lists for other BARGE events:

- [ATLARGE](https://groups.google.com/a/barge.org/g/atlarge)
- [FARGO](https://groups.google.com/a/barge.org/g/fargo)
