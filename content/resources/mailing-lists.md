BARGE maintains three mailing lists. Members can select which lists they wish to read.

## BARGE-announce

**BARGE-announce** is for major BARGE announcements, such as registration
opening and closing, etc.. This is a low volume moderated list. Everyone
interested in **BARGE or EMBARGO** should subscribe to this list.

To subscribe to this list, go to 
[https://groups.google.com/a/barge.org/g/barge-announce](https://groups.google.com/a/barge.org/g/barge-announce)

## BARGE

**BARGE** is a mailing list for general discussions about BARGE, BARGE members,
topics peripheral to the lives of BARGE members, stray thoughts that randomly
occur to BARGE members...on any subject except religion and politics (see
below). This list is decidedly not low volume, and subscribers may be exposed
to strongly held opinions with which they do not agree. You have been
warned. While this is a very open list, there are guidelines by which we expect
all participants to abide.  **EMBARGO** announcements are also made here.

## BARGE-RelPol

**BARGE-RelPol** was added for those die-hard BARGE members that find
themselves drifting more and more into esoteric or passionate debate about
decidedly non-BARGE general topic areas like religion or politics. This is
lower volume than the main BARGE list above, but is even more likely to expose
you to those strongly held opinions we refer to above.  While this is a very
open list, there are guidelines by which we expect all participants to abide.

To subscribe to this list, go to [https://groups.google.com/a/barge.org/g/barge-relpol](https://groups.google.com/a/barge.org/g/barge-relpol)

Note: the links to the mailing lists above also include instructions for unsubscribing.
