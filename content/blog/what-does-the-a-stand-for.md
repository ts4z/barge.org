BARGE is the Big August Rec.Gambling Excursion (to Las Vegas).  Except in years
in which it isn't in August, then BARGE is the Big Annual Rec.Gambling
Excursion (to Las Vegas).  For recent years, it's been in late July more often
than not.

New York Times Bestselling Author [Dave Barry](https://davebarry.com/) once
mocked us for this, when it was definitively the Big August Rec.Gambling
Excursion, and said that it should be [BJRGE](https://bjrge.org/) instead.

Either way, it's usually cold in the poker room, which is where we spend most
of our time, anyway.
