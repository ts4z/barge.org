BARGE is the Big August Rec.Gambling Excursion (to Las Vegas).  Except in years
in which it isn't in August, then BARGE is the Big Annual Rec.Gambling
Excursion (to Las Vegas).  For recent years, it's been in late July more often
than not.

Back when it was usually cited as the Big *August* Rec.Gambling Excursion, but
it happened in July, someone invited New York Times Bestselling Author [Dave
Barry](https://davebarry.com/).  He declined.  Moreover, he mocked us for the
event title, and said that it should be [BJRGE](https://bjrge.org/) instead.

Vegas in July or August... it's really hot outside but it's climate-controlled cold
in the poker room.  You can find us there.
