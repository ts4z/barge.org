<p>ABC loose-passive&rsquo;s are the easiest opponent&rsquo;s to
play, and you generally have the largest edge against them. Most lowstakes
players are ABC loose-passive. Aspiring to see many flops, they habitually
limp. Their propensity to call pre-flop raises varies, but they call pre-flop
raises much more than your average opponent. 
On the flop they tend to be fit or fold. Meaning, if they hit the flop,
they continue, if not, they&rsquo;ll fold.  The
good news is they&rsquo;re easily exploitable.</p>

 
 <p>One method of exploitation is merely playing
better starting hands. That way, you&rsquo;ll trap them when their inferior hands
provide you with big edges. You&rsquo;ll &ldquo;outkick&rdquo; them, set-over them, make higher
flushes and commonly make better hands than they will against you. You can also
play a wide range with position, but need to be aware of players behind you and
play well after the flop. If you&rsquo;re not a good post-flop player, don&rsquo;t play
your marginal hands pre-flop.</p>

 
 <p>Another exploitative method is to isolate and
continuation bet them. Since they&rsquo;re folding when they miss, and they&rsquo;ll miss
the flop around 60% of the time, a continuation bluff or semi-bluff is high
EV.  Unpaired starting hands make a pair
or better about 1/3rd of the time, but additional draws make the 60%
missed flop number a good approximation. When your opponent holds a small wired
pair, he will to miss almost 90% of the time. If you continuation bet &frac12; pot,
you need a fold 33% of the time to acquire immediate fold equity.  That&rsquo;s good EV, and those situations present
themselves repeatedly.</p>

 
 <p>When contemplating an isolation play, you need to
reasonably assess its effectiveness. If players behind are likely to call or
3-bet you, your isolation play has lost considerable value. If that is the case,
tighten up and exploit their weaker hands that way. Additionally, having
position strengthens isolation plays considerably.</p>

 
 <p>Making isolation/continuation bet plays also adds
value because it makes you harder to read, and you will acquire more action
when you hit your hand. When you&rsquo;re continuously betting at them, your opponents
will tend to call you more liberally.</p>

 
 <p>When continuation betting with a weak hand after
isolating, you&rsquo;ll need to take the board texture into consideration. Some
boards will hit your opponent&rsquo;s range more than others. Be more inclined to
check the boards that are more likely to hit your opponent&rsquo;s range. I.E. A
J♦-T♠-8♦ flop hits more of your opponent&rsquo;s range than a K♦-7♣-2♥h board.</p>

 
 <p>Those plays work well against ABC loose-passive
opponents. Just select the right situations and execute.</p>

 
 <p>And if you&rsquo;ve done that correctly, you&rsquo;ll improve
your edge tremendously.  </p>
