Many people don&rsquo;t know the exact difference between equity and EV. In
fact, some people use the terms as if they were identical.

Equity is the percentage chance that a hand will win after all the cards are
dealt. The percentage chance includes splits and is utilized when comparing
your holding against opponent&rsquo;s hand(s) or range(s).

The term is used in different ways, with or without more cards to come. Without
cards to come and your opponent&rsquo;s hand unknown, your equity is calculated
against his likely range. But with cards to come, when all the cards are known,
your equity is calculated by your chances after the river card is dealt. In
other words, your percentage chances on a runout. But with cards to come and
your opponents hand unknown, your equity is the percentage chance against his
feasible range.

For example: A♣K♣ has 45.76% equity against T♣T♥, which has 54.24% equity. That
said, equity doesn&rsquo;t include measuring the implied odds or economic value
of the hand. A6o has more pre-flop equity than K♠Q♠, as A6o has around 54%
pre-flop equity. But K♠Q♠ ought to win more money over time if the stacks are
deep because it has much better implied odds than A6o.

The reason being, among other things, is that K♠Q♠ plays better against your
opponents&rsquo; big bet calling/raising range, whereas A6o is likely to get
you in many trouble post-flop situations. And the true value of a hand is its
propensity to win money, not have the highest equity (unless
all-in). That&rsquo;s because the EV or expectation of some hands is stronger
than certain hands with higher equity due to the implied odds being better.

EV is your expectation. It&rsquo;s different from equity in that EV is the
average of what you can expect to win going forward with a given play. Folding
at the decision point has an EV of zero even if you have already invested money
in the pot. However, if you continue forward with your hand, the value of the
chips in the pot at the decision point is calculated into the expected return
on your play choice equation.

For example, if you&rsquo;re heads-up, have a gut shot after the turn as your
only win with $100 in the pot and are facing an all-in $30 bet, your EV is zero
if you fold and -$18.19 if you call the $30.  You&rsquo;re 9.09% to make the
straight and with $130 in the pot including your call, the $30 call returns an
average of $11.81. Since your call cost you $30, the call loses $18.19 of EV.

That&rsquo;s a simple example to explain the concept. Don&rsquo;t forget to
include the implied odds. In reality things get much more complicated as you
can&rsquo;t average together all the possible future scenarios in any given
hand. That said, understanding the concept and estimating the EV going forward
will formulate crisper decisions. And the closer you get to reality, the
tougher you&rsquo;re going to make it on your opponents.

Additionally, all gambling equations should be quantified in terms of
EV/expectation. We&rsquo;re taught to quantify things nominally. But, when
gambling, if you bet $10 with $15 expected return on your investment (EV),
you&rsquo;ve made $5 whether you win the hand or not.

Yeah, I know it doesn&rsquo;t feel that way, but just keep making those
positive EV bets and those chips WILL end up in your stack!
