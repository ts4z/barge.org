Great chess players are legendary for their ability to think
many moves ahead. But in poker, forward thinking is undervalued by most
players. How a hand will play out is the most important component of your
decisions. Current odds are chiefly immaterial, implied odds are how you should
calculate your probabilities. And to be able to closely estimate your implied
odds, you must read your opponents&rsquo; hands, their tendencies, and predict how
they will play differing scenarios. 
 
Plans fall into three main ranges. There are game plans, play
of hands plans, and exploitive strategy plans. Game plans are master plans for the specific
game you&rsquo;re in. Early in every session you should create a masterplan on how
you will exploit the game. Is this a game you&rsquo;re going to make money by making
your opponents fold when they should call? Or should your strategy be to wait
for situations or make hands in which you think the likelihood of being paid
off is high? Design your strategy to the way the game is, not the way you&rsquo;d
like to make it. People are creatures of habit and reluctant to change. 
 
Most games will possess a mix of opponents&rsquo; tendencies, and
you&rsquo;ll have to isolate situations based on their components. That said, having
a general idea of what principal strategy you want to pursue, and establishing your
image to accommodate that strategy will both add value and make your decisions
easier. 
 
The correct play is correlated to how the hand will play on
other streets. How a hand plays on the flop relates to how it will play on the
turn, which relates to how it will play on the river. Designing a strategy that
gets the highest overall edge on your holding, not just on the current street
is the optimum play. You should pass on
a small edged bet, if passing will allow you to obtain a higher edged bet(s) on
a later street(s). There are innumerable other application to this concept, you
just have to design and apply them. 
 
When you pay attention to how your opponents play, you&rsquo;ll
find exploitable weaknesses. When you do, you need to think about how different
hands will play in those circumstances. If your opponent folds too much, you&rsquo;ll
want to bluff more with the weak portions of your range, and trap more with its
strong portions. You&rsquo;re adjusting the play of your hand and adjusting which
hands to play based on exploiting how the hand will play out. If your opponent
has an exploitable weakness, playing correctly, 
increases the value of your holding, allowing you to play a weaker range
and/or adjust your calling, trapping and raising ranges to increase the value
of the exploitive play. 
 
Thinking moves ahead will produce higher value decisions.
You&rsquo;ll have a clearer picture of which hands to play and how to play them.
Focus on how the game plays; think about the game between hands. What plays can
I utilize to maximize my earn? 
 
Think ahead, and you&rsquo;ll find your chips ahead!
