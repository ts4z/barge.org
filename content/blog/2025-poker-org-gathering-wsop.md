[PokerOrg](https://poker.org/) will be hosting a player lounge at the
[WSOP](https://www.wsop.com/) this year &mdash; our second straight year. This
year, we want to do something special for Internet poker communities, which is
where you come in.

On Wednesday, June 25th, we’ll be hosting a special Poker Community Mixer at
the Legends Lounge in the Horseshoe Casino, and we’d love to have your
community be part of it. From 5:00pm-7:00pm we’ll make a special space
available to various poker communities. We’ll put out beverages and some
light snacks. It’s a way for your members to interact with each other, but
also for them to meet fellow poker fans from other communities. It should be
a great couple hours of handshakes, hugs, howdies, and the odd bad beat
story.

Our only expectation is that anyone attending the lounge become members of
PokerOrg (if they’re not already). If they’re not already members, they can
join (for free) at [poker.org](https://poker.org/).

Of course, once they’re members, they are welcome to access the lounge any
time while we’re there (from June 24th through July 11th). So your community
can use the lounge any time as a pre-dinner gathering spot or tournament
break check-in point.
