BARGE has been around longer than the World Wide Web itself, and in that time
we've accumulated a bunch of stuff that we would now call blogs.

One blog-like tradition is [Trip Reports](/tags/tripreport)[^1].  Sometimes these
are just about visits to casinos or blackjack conditions.  Sometimes they're
epic stories of degeneracy that have inspired others.  We've started collecting
them here.

[^1]: Trip reports have been modified to look better in modern web browsers and
    use Unicode.  We have also added some typos, just to spice things up.  If
    you find any issues, please let us know, and don't blame the author.

Our favorites are about BARGE.
