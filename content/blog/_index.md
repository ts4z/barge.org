BARGE has been around longer than the World Wide Web itself, and in that time
we've accumulated a bunch of stuff that, I guess, we now call blogs.

One blog-like tradition is [Trip Reports](/tags/tripreport).  Sometimes these are
just about visits to casinos or blackjack conditions.  Sometimes they're epic
degeneracy stories that have inspired others.  We've started collecting them here.
