BARGE has been around longer than the World Wide Web itself, and in that time
we've accumulated a bunch of stuff that we would now call blogs.

One blog-like tradition is [Trip Reports](/tags/tripreport).  Sometimes these
are just about visits to casinos or blackjack conditions.  Sometimes they're
epic stories of degeneracy that have inspired others.  We've started collecting
them here.

Our favorites are about BARGE.
