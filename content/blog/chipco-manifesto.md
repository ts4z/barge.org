Tom Sims did a lot of work on [BARGE chips](/chips/) even before the
[BCC](/chips/bcc/).  He was an active participant on rec.gambling.poker, and
every year, he'd share this, having been burned by quality issues with Chipco
chips [for the 1996 chips](/chips/gallery/1996/).

BARGE switched to Paulson as our vendor for the next few chipsets, then back to
Chipco, when Paulson proved difficult to work with.  Paulson no longer sells to
non-casino customers.  Chipco International has gone out of business.[^1]
For the past several years, BARGE chips have been produced by 
[BRPro Poker](https://brpropoker.com), who have been excellent to work with and
produced a high quality product.

This has been lightly edited for presentation.  The original is still available on
[Google groups](https://groups.google.com/g/rec.gambling.poker/c/7h2SYopYgeE/m/6Xx-2hUMPhcJ).

> Greetings From Las Vegas, Home of The BARGE:
>
> ## MY ANNUAL CHIPCO MANIFESTO
> 
> The 1996 BARGE chips were designed by me, and made by CHIPCO
> International of Windham, Maine. CHIPCO was selected because
> we were looking for a "different look" and we had been
> favorably impressed with some samples of their work.
> 
> I believe that the 1996 chips look pretty good in their
> overall appearance, but they have several quality control
> mistakes that CHIPCO refused to correct:
> 
> 
> 1. On the red chips, the red color bled slightly into the
> bottom of the five of spades graphic on about 80 % of the
> red chips. This only happened on the red chips.
> 
> 2. On all of the orange chips there is a slight
> discoloration extending to the left and the right of
> "HORSESHOE" in the Binion's logo. This only happened on
> the orange chips.
> 
> 3. The lettering on the edges of the chips was very sloppily
> done. The lettering was not centered vertically, and the
> print varied in degree of darkness on many of the chips.
> The lettering is not very crisp, is often blurry and/or
> smudged, and looks sort of like someone took a rubber
> stamp and stamped the lettering on the edge of the chips.
> 
> 4. The lettering on the edges of 2,313 of the chips faces
> one direction while the lettering on the edges of the
> remaining 1,717 chips face the opposite direction. Each
> of the ten different colors had about half of it's edge
> designs reversed in this fashion.
> 
> 5. Many of the chips have some sort of minor blemish: a tiny
> pit mark, or a tiny discoloration (usually white) or an
> irregularity on the edge that looks like a seam, and
> other flaws in the manufacturing process. One peach chip
> had a large white discoloration (about 1/4" x 1/8") on
> one side.
> 
> I had been very pleased with the proofs of the BARGE chips.
> There wasn't any bleeding or discolorations or blemishes on
> the proofs, and on the proofs the lettering on the edges was
> crisp, clear, vertically centered, and it all faced in the
> same direction.
> 
> After receiving the BARGE chips, I informed CHIPCO that they
> were unacceptable because of defects 1 through 4 listed
> above, and I requested that they redo the chips.
> 
> The President of CHIPCO put off a decision for over two
> weeks before refusing to redo the chips. He said that they
> put too much red ink in the mix for the red chips, that they
> let the orange chip cook a little too long, and that I never
> told them that all of the lettering in the edge design
> should face the same direction. He did not offer any
> comments or explanation of the sloppy lettering on the edge
> design or the blemishes on many of the chips. He said that
> in his judgment the flaws were not that serious and did not
> warrant redoing the chips. His basic attitude seemed to be
> that he was very concerned with his immediate profit and
> loss situation, and that the flawed chips that they had made
> for BARGE were "good enough for who they were for".
> 
> CHIPCO does not accept credit cards, and required payment in
> full from me (except for shipping charges) before I got the
> BARGE chips, so I had very little financial leverage in this
> situation. If they had been dealing with a casino or an
> important customer, they would not have required payment in
> advance, and the chips would have been rejected for any one
> of the defects listed above. The Chip Purchasing executives
> at two major Las Vegas casinos looked at our 1996 BARGE
> chips, and said that they would have rejected the order
> because of the quality defects.
> 
> I spent many weeks trying to appeal to CHIPCO's pride in
> their product and the desirability of maintaining a good
> reputation, and I really held out hope until the day before
> BARGE, that they might decide to do the right thing by us,
> and that a UPS truck would deliver some chips that looked
> like the proofs. I told them that they were capable of doing
> better work than the "seconds" they were foisting on us, and
> that we had paid for and deserved their best efforts. I also
> suggested that they could replace the edge lettering with
> stripes, if it was beyond their technical capability to
> produce edge lettering that looked like the proofs. This all
> fell on deaf ears.
> 
> Their short sightedness in this matter was/is unbelievable
> to me. Even after redoing them, they probably would have
> made a profit on the BARGE order, because I offered to try
> and sell the original chips as "seconds" and give the
> proceeds of the sales to CHIPCO. They also stood to benefit
> from several additional full set orders for which I had
> indications of interest. I don't understand how any company
> could commit such a public relations blunder.
> 
> Based on my experience with CHIPCO, I conclude that they are
> a company with serious quality control problems, that
> doesn't hesitate to foist a flawed product, that does not
> represent their best efforts, on their customers. What goes
> around comes around, and I believe/hope that the Poker God
> will get them in the long run.
