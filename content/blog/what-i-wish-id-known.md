### Talk to Anyone and Everyone.

Please don&rsquo;t be afraid to approach anyone with a badge.  Everyone wants
to meet you. Seriously.  Sometimes old timers get busy talking with other old
timers they haven&rsquo;t seen in a year, but they don&rsquo;t mean to ignore
you.  Walk up to anyone. Ask anything. If you somehow manage to find the one
Crabby Tabby in the group then just move on.

See some BARGErs at a restaurant table?  Ask if you can sit down. You will be
welcomed! Sharing a meal is an excellent way to get to know people better.

There&rsquo;s a saying at BARGE that &ldquo;there are no strangers at
BARGE&hellip;just friends you haven&rsquo;t met yet,&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s
true.

### It&rsquo;s Not All About Poker.

Well, it is all about poker, but at the same time it&rsquo;s not. Don&rsquo;t
be intimidated if you barely know how to play.  I learned to play NLHE around
4th of July and came to BARGE at the end of the month.  The tournaments
aren&rsquo;t that expensive and you&rsquo;ll learn a lot.  One friend I brought
had never played before!  One of those plastic poker tips cards and a few hands
in the hotel room and he had a blast.

Most of the players at BARGE are excellent, experienced and passionate about
poker.  A few are professional players. Some have cashed in the World Series of
Poker and a few BARGErs have won the WSOP Main Event.  Don&rsquo;t be
intimidated.  Hang out with them and ask questions.  BARGErs are generous with
their knowledge and love to talk about poker.

### Dive in.

The more you participate the more fun you&rsquo;ll have. It is not possible to
embarrass yourself at BARGE.  So don&rsquo;t be afraid to cut
loose. Don&rsquo;t know how to play a game?  Don&rsquo;t let that stop you from
playing. Just ask the table how to play or buttonhole a random BARGEr and ask
for a lesson.  Not a singer?  Don&rsquo;t let that stop you from singing at
Karaoke.  That guy wearing a sombrero and juggling dice?  Probably a district
court judge when he&rsquo;s at home. &ldquo;What happens in Vegas stays in
Vegas&rdquo; has never been more true than at BARGE.

### Take and Make Bets and Other Nonsense.

As the week goes on, you&rsquo;ll hear about people eating Keno crayons on a
dare, non-singers having to sing a song at Karaoke to pay off a bet, a man
wearing a dress to the Saturday tournament&hellip;&hellip; Participate!

### Carpool.

Ask for a ride if you need one, and offer to take people with you if
you&rsquo;ve got a car.  It&rsquo;s a great way to have a conversation and get
to know a few people better than you might&rsquo;ve otherwise.

### Figure out How to Stay in Touch at BARGE.

Twitter, Hangouts&hellip;.whatever people are using this year&hellip;be sure
that you&rsquo;re on the list and checking your notifications because people
will be doing all kinds of impromptu things like carpooling to Lotus of Siam,
going to the Pinball Museum, whatever.  All kinds of fun stuff pops up as
people think of it.
