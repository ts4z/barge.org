## THE BIG SLEEP (Or Complete Lack Thereof) &mdash; North Shore Mike at BARGE 2003 (LONG &mdash; A Serial in Three Installments)

NOTE TO THE UNINFORMED:  BARGE is the Big August Rec.Gambling Excursion,
a thirteen year-old tradition of drunken degenerate gamb00ling and
debauchery that is unparalleled in the annals of time, except for my
home game.  It is held annually in Las Vegas on the first weekend in
August.  If you haven&rsquo;t been, you should; just like Vegas itself, it
must be experienced at least once in one&rsquo;s life.  Visit www.barge.org
for more information.

DISCLAIMER:  This trip report is based on a true story, which means,
just like in Hollywood, absolutely nothing.  The author&rsquo;s PDA (a spiral
bound 3x5 Mead notebook with cheap pen shoved in the spiral) came home
with nary a single note, so all embellishments, exaggerations, and
outright fabrications are meant only to entertain and amuse; please, no
wagering.

### I AM SIXTEEN, GOING ON SEVENTEEN

It&rsquo;s been two years.  Two long, painful years since losing my BARGE
virginity, and, unlike most virgins, I can&rsquo;t wait for my next
experience.  My anticipation and excitement rival that I felt awaiting
the final Police Academy sequel.  I am sixteen again.

A slow, road-rage inducing drive through late afternoon Vancouver
traffic and I arrive at the door of South Shore Murray Logan, my home
game nemesis, and traveling companion for this long-awaited journey.
Murray will be attending his first BARGE himself this year, and I take
great care to explain that it&rsquo;s not all it&rsquo;s cracked up to be, and to
not allow himself to be too disappointed at what he experiences over the
next five days. The fool believes me.

After being dropped at Vancouver International by Murray&rsquo;s wife, the
beautiful Princess Leah, we encounter, at the Alaska Airlines check-in
desk, a line-up the length of Robert Downey Jr.&rsquo;s rap sheet.  I wonder
aloud if they&rsquo;re giving away free beer.  Eventually, we hear music to
our ears:  &ldquo;Would all passengers flying on flight 694 to Las Vegas
please come to the front of the line?&rdquo;  We bound gleefully past the
other weary travelers, sticking our tongues out at those who dare to
make eye contact.  My twenty-dollar Wal-Mart wheeled duffle loses an
axle during the sprint:  bad beat number one.

Security check-in is quick and painless.  Well, mostly painless:  my
stainless steel hip flask full of Bombay Sapphire is seized, as is
Murray&rsquo;s.  Security officers promise to return the flasks after they
have been emptied of their evil contents.  Murray&rsquo;s flask is returned
empty, as promised.  A fine young gentleman returns my vessel to me,
saying with a wink, &ldquo;I left a sip for you.&rdquo;  I shake the flask; it
appears half full!  I kiss his spit-shined jackboots, shake his hand,
and promise to send him a Christmas card.  Good beat number one.

Two and a half hours later, after a couple of victory toasts from the
Flask of Good Beats, and a cribbage game during which Luck Bucket Logan
kicked my ass to the tune of four bucks, we land in Shangri-La.  A quick
pickup of luggage, and we meet Tom &ldquo;Aardvark&rdquo; Hummel per our
pre-arranged pre-arrangement, and head to the limo stand.  I warn Tom
that a quick detour to a liquor store is needed, and he suspiciously
says he doesn&rsquo;t mind.  Our driver takes us to a Von&rsquo;s.  Booze in grocery
stores:  I love America.  (If any of my American readers don&rsquo;t
understand this last comment, come to Vancouver and try to get a cold
beer to go, anywhere, after 11:00 pm.  And the closest thing to alcohol
that grocery stores carry is salted peanuts.)

We emerge from Von&rsquo;s two hours later (gotta love flat-rate limos), laden
with gin, lemons, limes, cigarettes, bread, sixty-four slices of
American cheese, a National Enquirer, and a paring knife. To BARGE,
driver, and be quick about it!  Moments later, we stumble out of the
limo into the waiting arms of the Golden Nugget doormen.  Tony &ldquo;Karma&rdquo;
Goldstein is waiting to greet us, obviously forewarned of our arrival by
Las Vegas Metro Police.  

We ask for a north tower room at the Nugget, as I recalled wearing out
at least 2 pairs of Shoe Warehouse specials the last time I stayed in
the south tower: it&rsquo;s approximately seventeen miles from Fremont Street.
Good beat:  north tower room available.  Bad beat:  smoking room.  Good
beat:  I smoke.   Bad beat:  Murray doesn&rsquo;t.  We negotiate.  He balks.
I kick him in the shins.  He acquiesces.  I love passive players.  But I
must promise not to smoke in the room, so I give in.  The fool believes
me.  We dump our bags in the room and are back on the elevator, bound
for Binion&rsquo;s poker room, before our hotel room door latches shut.

### THE COCK KNEED REBEL

We immediately get into a rockin&rsquo; rammin&rsquo; jammin&rsquo; 4/8 Hold&rsquo;em game, the
inhabitants of which I cannot recall.    I do recall one r00ling moment:
ADB tiger transfers to the table, carrying a rather large scotch, and
about 3 racks of white&hellip;in his hat.  I say, &ldquo;Nice rack, sir.&rdquo;  Of
course, he looks down at his chest, to raucous laughter.  There is also
another player, apparently a local, whose accent gives him away as being
a native of London&rsquo;s east end.  His name is Derek, and he says he&rsquo;s
known as the Cockney Rebel.  I immediately begin to refer to him as The
Cock Kneed Rebel, craving acceptance from my fellow BARGE&rsquo;ers through
laughter, and they don&rsquo;t disappoint.  This guy&rsquo;s voice sounds like he
just drank gasoline, with a road gravel chaser.  I find him mildly
entertaining for about 3 minutes, but he talks louder and longer than
ADB Kevin Un, so he becomes tiresome.  He claims to be a morning radio
personality, failing to explain why he&rsquo;s still playing cards and boozing
at 1:00 am.  He claims to be a 30/60 player, failing to explain why he&rsquo;s
playing 4/8 at Binion&rsquo;s.  He also fails to explain why the BARGE&rsquo;ers at
the table wind up with most of his chips.  That, I can explain:  he
sucked.  This man was the railbird&rsquo;s railbird, who just happened to have
mooched a C-note to play in a 4/8 game.  Only a matter of time before he
hit someone up for a loan; I was terrified that he knew my name.  (Cue
ominous music.)

The remaining hours of the evening-slash-morning are like the Watergate
Tapes:  a great big gap, only it&rsquo;s like 18 hours, not 18 minutes.  I
vaguely recall meeting many old friends, such as Scott &ldquo;Scottro&rdquo; Harker,
Sean &ldquo;Oscar&rdquo; McGuiness, Michael &ldquo;Mickdog&rdquo; Patterson, Walter &ldquo;Walter&rdquo;
Hunt, and a host of others.  I played through the night, cashed out at
10:30 am ahead about a rack (boy, I sure know how to maintain a solid
hourly rate), realizing I must shower so I stink better for the noon
BARGE limit hold&rsquo;em tournament.  I stumble across Fremont, successfully
avoiding the Golden Nugget&rsquo;s crack security team, then shower and have
breakfast with Murray in the Carson Street Caf.  He bores me with tales
of how much fun BARGE is.  (Yawn.)


I SUCK, THEREFORE I&WELL·I JUST SUCK

Prior to the tournament, I stop at the table (wo)manned by Eileen and
Erin Milligan to pick up my home set of 400 BARGE chips.  This year&rsquo;s
design, created by the 2002 BARGE No-Limit Hold&rsquo;em Champion, Mike
&ldquo;Howler&rdquo; McBride (with the always able assistance of Patrick Milligan),
was so beautiful I just had to buy a whole bunch of Īem.  Each chip
color is adorned with a different historical work of art, all holding
&ldquo;Presto&rdquo;.  My favorite is the Michelangelo &ldquo;hand of god&rdquo; yellow chip.
Magnificent work, Howler.  Barely avoiding an aneurism (man, those
things are *heavy*), I lurch erratically towards my assigned tournament
seat.

I played wonderfully, making huge laydowns, and snapping off huge
bluffs.  (Pause now for riotous laughter.)  Actually, I just don&rsquo;t
recall much of anything in this tournament; I was still mildly, uh,
intoxicated. Obviously, I had a good time, because I was later quietly
chastised for my foul language; belated apologies to all I may have
offended.  After busting out fairly early, and paying Mickdog ten bucks
for my only last-longer bet, I travel with my other home game buddy, Ron
&ldquo;Duke Mantee&rdquo; Nutt, and Seth Maixner, leader of the 2003 BARGE Virgins,
to the Gambler&rsquo;s General Store.  I pick up a box of playing cards for my
kids, and a beautiful mahogany-lined chip case for their father,
complete with a set-up of KEM cards.

I must sleep.  I must sleep.  I must sl&hellip;what&rsquo;s that?  The PokerStars
hospitality suite is open?  I&rsquo;ll be right there.  Up to room 1819 at
Binion&rsquo;s where our benevolent sponsor has arranged for a suite complete
with free t-shirts, hats, and booze.  The suite will be open 24/7 for
the duration of BARGE.  Way cool, folks.  They are also giving away the
greatest online poker marketing schwag ever:  big thick white rubber
bands with the PokerStars logo emblazoned across them.  In other words:
bankroll bands!  Ingenious. I&rsquo;m sure they cost no more than a buck a
million, but everybody talked about them all week.

I must sleep.  No, I must eat, then sleep.  So Murray, Seth and I join
the Family Milligan for dinner at the Nugget&rsquo;s Carson Street Caf, my
favorite coffee shop in Las Vegas, where I thoroughly enjoyed the best
brisket sandwich west of the Gold Spike.  Talk ranges from poker chips,
to Patrick&rsquo;s poker tournament clock software, to, um, some other stuff,
I think.  I am now approaching 36 hours of drunken awakedness, and once
again the details go blurry.  I really, really, needed to get some
sleep.  But, alas, one of the mo&rsquo; funner BARGE events was nearing its&rsquo;
start time.

### YOU SEE HORSE, I SEE HORSE, WE ALL C-HORSE

The team C-HORSE event is one of my favorites.  As the name suggests,
teams of six compete in six different games:  Crazy pineapple, Hold&rsquo;em,
Omaha/8, Razz, Stud, and stud Eight or better.  The flop games are
played on one table, the board games on another; at the end of each
round, each team&rsquo;s stacks are balanced, and we do it all again, until a
fixed number of rounds, or fixed time limit, is reached.  The team with
the most money wins. It&rsquo;s a blast.

Team Moosecock (our name comes from the punchline of the funniest joke
ever written&hellip;just ask Murray Logan) consisted entirely of Canadians:  Me
(hold&rsquo;em) Murray, (Stud/8), Ron &ldquo;Duke Mantee&rdquo; Nutt (CP), John Harkness
(Razz), Ken Kubey (O/8), and virgin Ali Mohajer (Stud).  Okay, okay, Ken
and Ali are not really Canadians, we drafted them via e-mail, but Ali
correctly identified the Toronto hockey team as the Make Believes, and
Ken can say &ldquo;eh&rdquo;? with the best of Īem.

Well, I did *my* job, as our stack on the flop table increased every
round I played but one; everybody else sort of floundered (kidding,
boys).  But Ali won a huge stud pot right near the buzzer to drag us,
kicking and screaming, into profitability.  Total team profit:  twelve
bucks.  High fives all around, boys!  However, I do lose a
double-sawbuck each to Scottro and Mickdog, as their respective teams
beat us in the standings, we finished sixth of nine entries.

I may have played some poker after that.  Or not.  But, fuelled by many
Michelobs, I felt rejuvenated, so I eagerly accepted a gracious
invitation to the craps pit from Peter &ldquo;ADB Foldem&rdquo; Secor and Chris &ldquo;ADB
Ploink&rdquo; Straghalis.  Danger awaits.

## PART II

NOTE TO THE UNINFORMED:  BARGE is the Big August Rec.Gambling Excursion,
a thirteen year-old tradition of drunken degenerate gamb00ling and
debauchery that is unparalleled in the annals of time, except for my
home game.  It is held annually in Las Vegas on the first weekend in
August.  If you haven't been, you should; just like Vegas itself, it
must be experienced at least once in one's life.  Visit www.barge.org
for more information.

DISCLAIMER:  This trip report is based on a true story, which means,
just like in Hollywood, absolutely nothing.  The author's PDA (a spiral
bound 3x5 Mead notebook with cheap pen shoved in the spiral) came home
with nary a single note, so all embellishments, exaggerations, and
outright fabrications are meant only to entertain and amuse; please, no
wagering.

(When we last left our hero, he was wisely going to shoot dice after 362
Michelobs and a tequila, in the company of two shady looking
characters..)

I WOULDN'T BELONG TO ANY CLUB THAT WOULD HAVE ME AS A MEMBER..EXCEPT
THIS ONE

Ploink, Foldem and I manage to find the craps pit at Binion's without
going by way of the Four Queens, which, given our condition, may rank as
the single most amazing feat of this or any BARGE.  After Ploink rolls
the dice for twenty minutes and we all take down a nice little profit, I
turn to see the two of them looking at me.  Grinning.  Like proud
parents.  As if in a dream, Foldem says, in slow motion:

"Welcome to the ADB's, North Shore."

And extends his hand, which I take in a daze.  Ploink slaps me on the
back.  I scream to the heavens:  "YOU LIKE ME!  YOU REALLY, REALLY LIKE
ME!"  (Actually, I yelled "Cocktails!", but I've learned to never let
the truth get in the way of a good Sally Field joke.)

The ADB's (alt.drunken.bastards) are a sub-group within the BARGE
community with which I have always had a strange camaraderie (I can't
imagine why).  While some of you may find it a dubious distinction at
best to be welcomed into a group of, well, fun drunk people, I find it
to be a tremendous honor; I take my bad habits very seriously.  Plus I
now get to wear a cool hat.  Woohoo!

Energized yet again, I roll back to the poker room and lock horns in
another rollicking 4/8 game, which contains ActionBob, PrestoET, and
various other nefarious looking characters.  Any game which contains
these two gentlemen is a good game, and not for the reason you think:
they practice excellent game selection.  I was only too happy to join
in, if only to make their game selection even better. We play for a few
hours, and I couldn't tell you if I won or lost; I was still on my
post-ADB-selection high (the cocktail count may have had something to do
with it, as well.).

### DEATH MARCH 2003 (or HOW I QUIT WORRYING AND LEARNED TO LOVE ACTIONBOB)

At 3:30 am, ActionBob reminds me we are in the same foursome teeing off
in 2 hours, and wonders if I would be agreeable to a little $20 Nassau
bet.  I stare at him.

Holy crap.  I have to play golf in two hours.

The Death March is one of my favorite memories from BARGE 2001, when
eight of us braved 108 degree temperatures to tackle the Legacy Golf
Club.  Apparently, there was no March (no, not the month, you silly
goose) in 2002; I guess since I was not in attendance, the game
selection sucked.  Then, like now, I had stayed up all night playing
poker prior to hitting the links.  But this time, I'd stayed up TWO
nights; not even I had ever attempted this Herculean feat.  I briefly
contemplated a ninety minute nap, but knew in my dark, alcohol-preserved
heart that I would never wake in time.  So, ActionBob and I shook hands
on the Nassau bet, and played on, calling for cocktails for the
bazillionth time, give or take.

4:30 am, I hustle over to the Nugget for a quick, bracing icy shower and
a change of clothes, careful not to wake my roommate Murray.  But wait:
there is an unruffled bed where Murray should be.  Perhaps he's having
fun after all.  I am flipping the bird to the Sun God:  today, I wear
black (it IS the Death March, after all.).   Lugging my
already-too-heavy golf bag across the street, I meet the rest of the
idio..er, Death Marchers in Binion's poker room at 5:00 am sharp.

On hand are Nolan "ADB Darkside" Dalla, Gavin Smith, ActionBob, David
Aronson, Kevan Garrett, Ken "QB" Kubey, Gerald "Gerdog" Petersen, my
good buddy Scott Burrington (who really needs a nickname in the worst
way), and yours truly.   But wait:  here's an extremely well-oiled ADB
Ploink threatening to come along!  For reasons I simply cannot fathom, I
agree to pay his green fees if he pays for club rental.  And so we are
ten.

Nolan graciously offers me a ride to the course, which I graciously
accept.  On the way to the valet parking area, I pretend not to notice
the "Wet Paint" sign on the wheelchair ramp at the curb.  I discreetly
put my right foot on the edge of the painted area, and pretend to slip
and fall right on my snowy-white Canadian ass.  Boy, all of those guys
were sure fooled by my fake pratfall.  I was even acrobatic enough to
get paint only on my right forearm and my golf bag!  I briefly
considered calling for a lawyer (there are about 300 of them at BARGE),
but Binion's has treated us so well, I decide not to follow through on
my evil scheme.

Injuries sustained only by pride and dignity, and giving my best "I
meant to do that" look, I crumple red-faced into the car and we head to
the Badlands Golf Club (cue Jaws theme music).  Upon arrival, there is
mild confusion in the pro shop, as Ploink has not pre-registered.  I pay
his fee and spell his name to the pro shop clerk.  Ploink is amazed I
can spell his surname.  I am amazed either of us can stand upright.

I am playing with ActionBob (cart buddy), Ploink, and Scott Burrington.
On the first tee, I pull-hook my drive into the desert waste area.  I
have not hooked a drive since 1991.  I catch ActionBob, who is safely
down the middle, grinning.  I am in for a bumpy ride.  Ploink peels a
Heineken off the six-pack he managed to somehow cajole out of the
clubhouse, and hands it to me; it does not taste good.  

The Badlands Golf Club, from what little I can remember as of this
writing, is a beautiful course, lined with palatial homes of every
shape, but only one size:  monstrous.  At one point, a conversation in
our foursome went like this:

North Shore Mike:  Is that a hospital? {{< br >}}
Scott: Naw, I think it's a high school. {{< br >}}
ActionBob: Actually, I think it's the servants' quarters {{< br >}}
Ploink: (hic) {{< br >}}

### GOODNIGHT, SWEET PRINCE (or HUSH, HUSH SWEET NORTH SHORE)

We manage to make it through the front nine remarkably unscathed, with
me down one hole to ActionBob in our match.  No matter, I will kick his
Jersey ass up and down the back nine, and win honor and glory for
Canada, not to mention twenty bucks.  To my huge surprise, I'm not
sucking too badly, and we've only been warned by the marshall once to
speed up our play.

Ploink goes into the clubhouse, carrying his clubs.  Huh?  Maybe he's
switching to left-handed ones, trying to pull some kind of Titanic
Thompson-esque hustle on us.  But no, he emerges clubless.  Claims he's
beat, and can't continue.  Weenie.  So, we soldier on without him,
wearing black armbands for our fallen comrade.

Alas, I think he planted a seed in my tiny booze-addled brain:  on the
12th tee, I caught myself nodding off while sitting in the cart.  Not
just getting drowsy, mind you, oh no: full-on bobbing for chest hairs.
I slapped myself, hard, once in each cheek.  Then I hit myself in the
face.  It seemed to work.

Until the 14th fairway, that is.  I was down one on the back nine to
ActionBob, so down two overall, but still had a small chance to squeak
out a victory.  But there I was, walking from the cart to the green, and
I was falling asleep, *while I walked*.  I was actually in danger of
crumpling peacefully to the lush green grass like a narcoleptic Jack
Nicklaus!  Yes, I had hit The Wall, nearly 50 hours after the odyssey
had begun.

Once back in the cart, safe from being shredded by tractor mowers, I
said, "ActionBob, our $20 Nassau bet just became a $60 last longer bet.
And you just won."  I weakly extended my hand in a congratulatory
gesture, but I passed out, into a surprisingly comfortable slumber,
before my opponent could grasp it.

ActionBob had to elbow me each time he needed to move the cart, and I
managed to hold on long enough to reach each stop, and then fall asleep
again.  I cannot imagine a more comical sight.  I only wish someone else
was at the center of it.  At least I can say I came by my new-found ADB
status honestly, no?

Back in the clubhouse, sprawled across a leather couch, I continued a
pattern of dozing and waking, while the boys had a post-round cocktail.
Every time I woke, I saw another Marcher staring at me, shaking his head
and going, 'tsk, tsk'.  I was too tired to fight back.  Nolan delivered
me back to the 'Shoe, apparently, and I have absolutely no recollection
of getting to my room.  The Odyssey finally reached a peaceful, merciful
end nearly 52 hours after it began.

### THIS JUST IN:  HELL HAS FROZEN OVER

I do recall asking for three separate wakeup calls, for 4 pm, 4:15, and
4:30, just to make sure I was on time for a 5 o'clock cocktail party at
Paul Phillips' humble home, to be followed by the
Paul-and-Lee-Jones-hosted baby pot limit game at the Mirage.

Murray woke me up at 9:15 pm.

Holy crap.  I missed a cocktail party.

Paul and I have maintained an extremely informal contact over the two
years since I met him, and I was thrilled to be invited to his home; I
was very upset with myself that my, um, lifestyle had prevented me from
honoring that invitation.  I hope he can forgive me.

So now I've missed the baby PL game, too.  Damn.  Damn, damn, damn.
But, my depression did not last long; Murray, who was seated in the
10/20 Hold'em game at the 'Shoe, gave me that "you gotta get in here"
look as I passed the table, so I got on the list, and sat in a 4/8 game
with a couple of  BARGE'ers I didn't (and still don't) know, and a
couple of entertaining locals.

Andy, the Horseshoe dealer, was regular player all week in the 4/8, and
was always a pleasure to play with, even when he was r00ling me with T6
offsuit.  There was another guy in the game who always gave me a smile
and a handshake whenever he saw me for the whole week, whose name was
Juan.  Never one to let a good nicknaming opportunity pass me by, I
immediately dubbed him "Juan Motime".  He was a pretty solid low-limit
player, and we hit it off right away.  Guys like this always make my
Horsehoe poker experience that much better.

outright fabrications are meant only to entertain and amuse; please, no
wagering.

(When we last left our hero, he was waiting to be seated in a rockin'
10/20 hold'em table in Binion's poker room)

### CRAPS CRAWL?  HELL, I CAN DO BOTH THOSE THINGS

After an hour or so of small losses at the 4/8, I finally get called to
the 10/20, where I quickly see the reason for Murray beckoning me in to
the game:  it is paradise, softer than Oprah's ass.  S00per l00se,
s00per passive, my favorite game conditions.  It is The Best Game Ever
West Of The Pink Chip Game.  Flop top pair, and get paid off by cheese
in three-part harmony.  Rinse.  Repeat.  Sweet.  Gentleman in his
early-to-mid sixties sits down with a rack, and each time it's his turn
to act he has another question for the dealer.  It becomes quickly
apparent that he has never played poker in a casino before.  Sweeter.
An hour (and $150 to the good) later, Foldem comes by the table to
remind us that the annual ADB Craps Crawl gets underway in the Binion's
craps pit in 10 minutes.  It dawns on me that I have made a profit the
first time I have ever played higher than $6/12 in Las Vegas.  I am
invincible.

BARGE is the only place/event on earth at which I would leave this game,
for any reason.  Ever.  Except maybe a fire, and even then..

I didn't attend the Craps Crawl back in 2001, and I really can't
remember why.  But now, as a newly-anointed ADB'er, my attendance is, at
least in my mind, mandatory.  Murray and I wander through the haze of
Binion's, finally coming across the Crawl's first stop in full swing.
The roaring crowd, at least 3 deep around the entire circumference of
the table, is 90% BARGE'ers, all suitably and expectedly well-oiled.  It
is, for the moment, the funnest place in Las Vegas.

We wedge our way in to the rail, pissing off the only two locals at the
table.  I give one of them a dollar for his trouble.  He looks at me
like I have a houseplant growing out of my nose.  He takes the dollar
anyway, albeit with suspicion in his eyes.

Moments later, Murray shouts like he's seen a ghost.  He elbows me, and
points toward the Fremont Street entrance.  There's a guy playing the
Bix 6 wheel.  In all my years of casino gaming, I've never seen anyone
put dollar one down on the Big 6 wheel (Ken QB's trip report doesn't
count; I didn't witness it, so I bet he made the whole thing up).

A couple of mid-long rolls later, I am ahead $80.  My invincibility is
now etched in stone.  Next stop:  The El Cortez.  Foldem advises us to
stay together while walking up Fremont Street, and avoid eye contact
with anyone.  Ah, sweet adventure.

It is my first visit to the El Cortez.  The place smells of misery.  I
plan to change that.  Its' walls are lined with wood paneling
reminiscent of my Uncle Elmer's rumpus room.  I don't plan to change
that; it's so tacky, it's almost cool.  The Crawlers have swollen in
number, but the El Cortez management, in a decision that must be, in Las
Vegas history, unequalled in stupidity, refuses to open a second table
for a bunch of drunken gamblers with bucketloads of cash.  The spurned
Crawlers finally convince the floor to open a 1-3 stud table.  Oh, I
see, that will make you *loads* more money.  Sheesh.

### THE GAVIN

Immediately to my left is Ploink, to my right are Nolan "ADB Darkside"
Dalla (who is living up to his name by betting heavily against the
shooters), Nick Christenson, and Gavin Smith, a fellow Canadian who I
had met only briefly that morning on the Death March.  He's drunk, and
loud.  Like me.  So, of course, we became fast friends.  Henceforth, he
shall be named The Gavin.  It will become apparent why he deserves so
regal a nickname.  The Crawl is now moving to Fitzgerald's.  I cash out
with a loss of $90.  Invincibility is highly overrated.

Fitzgerald's is brighter and cleaner than I remember it, and their craps
dealers were the most fun and competent on the Crawl.  Ploink rolls for
10 minutes, making several points and each of us a nice little profit.
Foldem comes to the table, and rolls for ten minutes.  I do the same.  A
local guy rolls for 15 minutes.  I cash out with a $300 profit.
Invincibility is making a comeback.

Murray, Ron Nutt, Sethro, and Shelley Louie join me in a late night gut
bomb at McDonald's inside the Fitz.  Murray pulls the old "Hey, look at
that!" grift and manages to steal half of my fries.  I can't believe I
fell for it.

Off to the Four Queens.  Many more Michelobs, and there may have been a
couple of tequilas.  I lose two hundred bucks.  Invincibility appears to
have moved, and didn't leave a forwarding address.

It is now 4:00 am.  To the Main Street Station.  Their in-house-brewed
pale ale is exquisite.  The dice are not.  I make a huge comeback,
though, to wind up losing sixty bucks for the session.  Net winner on
the evening.  Frank "Nut-Z" Brabec, who looks really really tired, says
goodnight to his wife Shari, and leaves for bed.  Moments later, Shari
is rolling the dice, and Murray ambles up and asks her where Frank went.
Shari, who will not remove her gaze from the table, says, "I think he
went to bed, the wimp.  COME ON, SIX!", and rifles the dice down the
felt.  Gawd, I love BARGE.

R00ling moment at the table:  The Gavin, who consistently gives the
dealers a hard time for not paying him off on non-existent bets which he
truly believes he's made, has the floor keeping a very close eye on him.
I intervene in one such argument, and he seems to believe me that he
isn't owed any money.  The dice are now his, and after establishing a
point of five, he rolls three consecutive 3-craps.  The young Crips
and/or Bloods at the other end of the table are giving him some
good-natured ribbing.  The Gavin shouts, "If I roll another craps this
time, this guy," - pointing to me - "will punch me in the head, as hard
as he can!"  I cock my fist next to his ear, ready to carry out the
sentence.  He rolls the winner five.  I give him a kiss on the cheek,
and one of the gang-bangers runs down to our end of the table to
high-five us both.  I am overcome by emotion, and begin to weep
uncontrollably.

We stumble wearily back to the 'Shoe, spouting some crap about getting
into a 4/8 game.  Although I was nearly convinced to actually do it, I
really wanted to give myself at least a remote chance at a better
performance in that day's Tournament of Champions-style tournament.  To
bed, it is, as the sun begins to light the pre-dawn sky.

### THE BLIND PIG FINDS A TRUFFLE

A Rip Van Winkle-esque 6 hour sleep later, I grab some breakfast at the
Nugget, and head over for the ToC-style tourney.  I am almost
exclusively a hold'em player; I can sort of find my way around stud, but
my Omaha/8 game..hell, I don't even have one.  As a result, my
expectations are lower than a snake's belly.  My strategy is to lose as
little as possible at Omaha, break even in stud, and make hay in the
hold'em rounds.

Oh, the best laid plans of mice and men..I made money every single stud
round, broke essentially even on the Omaha rounds, and lost money on the
hold'em rounds.  Perhaps it's time to re-evaluate my areas of skill.  I
don't recall if I've ever played better poker in a tournament.  I
actually didn't suck too badly.  A large factor in my success was a
significant cheering section of BARGE buddies giving me constant
encouragement; you know who you are, and I am eternally grateful.  One
even noticed that I seemed to win more pots when my chair was turned
backwards; gonna have to remember that one.

Down to two tables, and I am approaching short stack desperation status;
the game has now switched to no limit hold'em for the duration.   Sabyl
arrives at our table with a very large stack.  I manage to wake up with
a couple of hands when she's open-raised, and take a significant number
of chips from her, giving me some breathing room.  One hand,  I can't
hold it any longer:  I have to go so bad my back teeth are floating.  I
forego my under the gun hand and sprint to the washroom, when The Gavin
gives all attendees a story for the ages, and I missed it.  Here's how
it went down from my perspective at the urinal:

The Gavin is an excellent player, and is very, very dangerous when he
has chips.  He, along with Fich, is one of the two largest stacks at
this point.  He is also roaring drunk, and shows no signs of slowing
down, in neither the poker nor boozing departments.

From the men's room, I hear the unmistakable bellow of The Gavin:  "SEND
IT BABY, SEND IT!",followed by loud whoops of joy, and huge laughter
from the large gallery.  I start to laugh out loud; I'm sure my fellow
relievers at the other urinals instantly believed I was laughing at what
I was holding in my hands that moment.  But they were wrong.

I return to my seat to hear that The Gavin, upon winning a huge pot, and
screaming like a banshee, then sprinted through a victory lap around the
entire perimeter of the tournament area, slapping high-fives to all he
passed.  Somewhere, Hale Irwin was very proud.

I manage to steal a few blinds here and there, and every few minutes
there's more applause as another player busts out.  We are now
consolidated to a single table, but there are ten left, and only nine
get seats at the final final table.  Fich is laying a holy beating on
the table, his stack rivals the size of the debt of the state of
California.  One of the few times he had folded from early position, I
open raise in the cut-off with a moderately strong hand I don't quite
recall, even though I had only consumed one beer for the day (I can't
believe I just wrote that, and that it's true).  Chic Natkins, who is
very short-stacked in the small blind, calls all in with QJo, and my
hand holds up. (Chic had also bubbled in a Mirage tournament the day
before; sorry, buddy.)  I am greeted by several well-wishers with
handshakes and high-fives.  The most enthusiastic greetings are from
Murray and Mickdog, who each own a percentage of me, by virtue of some
pre-BARGE swapping.  Oh, well, I know they'd probably be happy for me
even if they didn't have a piece of me.  Probably.

Holy crap.  I made the final table of a BARGE event.  Get your bets down
now:  the Cubs just may win the Series this year.

The table breaks at 5:30; the final table will commence at 8 o'clock,
after the No-Limit Hold'em Calcutta.er, Symposium.  I curse the extra
hours in which to lose what little confidence I have mustered over the
past five hours, but, at the same time, I welcome a break from the
bone-crushing pressure.  Man, that was hard work; any of you who have
played in *ARG* events know that these tournaments must be the toughest
low-limit tournament fields in the known poker universe.  I was
absolutely thrilled to have made it this far.

Coming soon in Part IV (I know I said three parts, but I'm so goddamned
long-winded):

## PART IV

*posted Tue, 26 Aug 2003 04:09:25 -0700*

NOTE TO THE UNINFORMED:  BARGE is the Big August Rec.Gambling Excursion,
a thirteen year-old tradition of drunken degenerate gamb00ling and
debauchery that is unparalleled in the annals of time, except for my
home game.  It is held annually in Las Vegas on the first weekend in
August.  If you haven&rsquo;t been, you should; just like Vegas itself, it
must be experienced at least once in one&rsquo;s life.  Visit www.barge.org
for more information.

DISCLAIMER:  This trip report is based on a true story, which means,
just like in Hollywood, absolutely nothing.  The author&rsquo;s PDA (a spiral
bound 3x5 Mead notebook with cheap pen shoved in the spiral) came home
with nary a single note, so all embellishments, exaggerations, and
outright fabrications are meant only to entertain and amuse; please, no
wagering.

(When we last left our hero, he had somehow managed to suck out just
enough to make it to a tournament final table&hellip;)

### THE BLACK HOLE OF THE CALCUTTA

Still in a daze (not unlike the previous three days) wondering how I
managed to actually make a final table, I make my way upstairs to the
banquet room for the Calcutta draw&hellip;er, I mean, &ldquo;symposium&rdquo;.

The Symposium has recently come under some fire from long-time
BARGE&rsquo;ers; some say it goes on too long, some say it wastes valuable
positive EV time at the tables, some bitch about the food.  I, however,
am one of those who actually enjoy the damned thing.  Each player in the
next day&rsquo;s No-Limit Hold&rsquo;em event is paired with another, either
randomly or with pre-arranged partner; each pairing is then auctioned
off to the highest bidder.  (Players who made the previous year&rsquo;s final
table in this event are auctioned off individually.)  Every player is
auctioned.  If you &ldquo;buy&rdquo; a player that makes the money in the event, you
are paid the same proportion of the Symposium prize pool as the player
is paid from the tournament prize pool.  Simple, fun, and a cool way to
stay in action even after you&rsquo;re eliminated from the tournament
yourself.  To make it even better, each player can buy back a piece of
his own action from his purchaser, so if you cash in the event, you can
make an even bigger score.

Note to the Nevada Gaming Commission:  Of course, all purchases are made
with play money.  No cash actually changes hands.  No, really, this is
all just for fun.  Seriously.  Ask anyone.

Cocktails and hors d&rsquo;ouevres for the entire event, in an unprecedented
show of support for BARGE, are being generously supplied by the good
folks at Binion&rsquo;s Horseshoe.  Since having to pay for alcohol in Las
Vegas goes against everything I (and Las Vegas) stand for, this gesture
is greatly appreciated.

Fellow Canucks Murray, Ron and I decide to throw fifty bucks into a
purchasing syndicate led by Foldem, and to possibly pick up a bargain or
two on our own.  I buy the pairing of Sean &ldquo;Oscar&rdquo; McGuiness and David
&ldquo;Heldar&rdquo; Heller for the Old Navy-esque price of sixty bucks.  The
Canadian Triumvirate picks up our C-HORSE teammate Ali Mohajer, along
with somebody else whose name escapes me, for a similar price.  I am
purchased by Dave Croson, and buy back my action accordingly.  Murray
and I buy back most of The Gavin&rsquo;s action from him.  The action is
furious, the atmosphere charged, as Foldem keeps pounding the gavel.  I
love this event.

Murray and his pairing partner are bought by the Foldem syndicate, so we
have a small piece of him, too.  Foldem, always ready to make a BARGE
virgin feel welcome, says to Murray:  &ldquo;Oh, Murray Logan is YOU??
Ferchrissakes, how about that?  I was only interested in the OTHER guy!&rdquo;
Nothing like building your horse&rsquo;s confidence before the big event.

### THE SEARCH FOR TRUFFLES:  THE ADVENTURE CONTINUES

Throughout the Calcutta auction, I am trying to maintain something
resembling focus on the final table of the TOC-style event that was due
to start at 8:00 pm.  I have my second and third beers of the day,
trying to calm my jangling nerves; it helps, a little.    After the
auction ends in a BARGE-record of 90 minutes, the crowd filters out and
downstairs, for ring games, dinner, or to watch the final table.

The final table lineup is, as is the norm at these events, a formidable
one.  There is The Gavin, ADB Fich, Steve Watanabe, Beth Even, me, David
&ldquo;/david&rdquo; Huberman, &ldquo;ActionBob&rdquo; Hwang, Gillian Groves, and Foldem.  If
you can&rsquo;t spot the fish in the first five minutes at the table&hellip;

I notice that the table is covered with virtually brand new felt, with a
World Series of Poker logo printed in the center.  I ask David Huberman,
who is immediately to my left, if this is &ldquo;the&rdquo; table, as in the final
table at the Series.  He confirms that he has been told it is.  How cool
is that?

I turn to the sound of a London East End accent, shouting something in a
voice that can only be described as a cross between Harvey Fierstein and
Brenda Vaccaro.  It is Derek, the Cock-Kneed Rebel, who has arrived on
the scene with six Corona&rsquo;s for the table.  He is babbling something
which is completely incoherent; I get a good laugh from the crowd when I
shout, &ldquo;English only at the table, sir!&rdquo;

The Gavin and Fich have monster stacks.  Most of the rest of us are low,
or on fumes; I have 3 times the big blind.  We high card for the button,
and I draw the under-the-gun spot.  I am dealt ATo.  Although I am
nervous, I sense that so are a lot of the others; while I realize this
is a total steal hand from UTG, as I can&rsquo;t stand a re-raise, I need
chips fast.  I want to win, not just creep up the pay ladder.  I make it
four times the big blind to go.  All fold, and I&rsquo;ve accomplished quite a
few things here:  I picked up some chips, I established (I hope) an
aggressive image, and I put aside the rampaging herd of butterflies in
my gut.  Wanting to foster another side of my image, I ordered another
Michelob.

My attempt at re-establishing a drunken gamb00ler image goes largely
unnoticed.  The reason is two words: The Gavin.  He is now ordering rum
and Cokes two at a time.  There is so little Coke in them that they are
the color of iced tea.  I bow to his prowess and skill as a boozer.  And
he&rsquo;s a hell of a poker player, too:  a dangerous combination, to be
sure.

I win another smallish pot a few hands later.  Beth Even is first to
bust when she calls all in with AKo, and doesn&rsquo;t improve.  Foldem, who
has nursed a tiny stack as far as he could take it, is next to go.
ActionBob soon follows him.  Fich and The Gavin are playing very fast
(as they should), yet staying out of each other&rsquo;s way (as they should).
While I wasn&rsquo;t quite desperate yet, I was the shortest stack and needed
to find a way to double up soon.  That hand came during the 2nd hand of
the third orbit.

It was folded to Fich, who was in 4th position of 7 players.  He raised
immediately to 4 times the big blind.  It&rsquo;s folded to me in the big
blind spot.  I have an ace and a five, both of spades.  Once The Gavin
is out of a pot, Fich has been raising with pretty much any two cards,
and has been quite successful.  If I call, I&rsquo;m all in.  I *hate* calling
all in without a monster; it&rsquo;s obviously much better to be raising all
in than calling.  But given my chip position, and given Fich&rsquo;s very fast
play, I called, and turned my hand over.

He shows a king and a seven, offsuit.  I am quite pleased.

A seven hits the flop.  I am quite displeased.

No improvement, and I bust out in sixth place.  Although I am
experiencing the inevitable disappointment one feels after busting out
of any tournament, I got my money in with slightly the best of it, and
cashed for the first time in any *ARG* event, to the tune of $860.  And
they&rsquo;re US dollars, too:  for a Canadian, that ain&rsquo;t so bad.

ADB Jester, who is also a PokerStars employee, gives me a PS golf shirt
for making the final table.  I then fill out the requisite paperwork
with the world&rsquo;s youngest looking tournament director, Jan Holubowicz,
tip him a green chip, and leave the final table area, bolstered with the
congratulations, backslaps, and hugs from my many well-wishers.  Many,
many thanks to all who cheered me on; it was a huge confidence booster
for me.  You know who you are.

Torn between watching the rest of the event and my need for some quiet,
I leave the ĪShoe, bound for the solitude of my room at the Nugget.
Immediately upon leaving the ĪShoe, I am approached on Fremont Street by
a beautiful young woman, who apparently has fallen on hard times.  She
offers me a watch, one of those vintage digital models where you have to
press a button on the side of the case to light the LED time display.
Succumbing to my sense of nostalgia, and a sense that I need to help
her, I give her five dollars for it.  She is grateful, and hugs me.  I
feel better immediately.

After a brief respite watching a Jerry Springer episode (&ldquo;Transsexual
Grandmothers Who Run Crack Houses And Have Slept With The Entire Trailer
Park&rdquo;; I give it four and a half stars), I return to the Horseshoe
intent on crushing the ring games.  I sign up for the 10/20 Hold&rsquo;em, and
am seated almost immediately in the five seat.  After a half hour, I
have identified only one other decent player: BARGE&rsquo;er John Reeves, who
is very solid and occasionally tricky, in the two seat. Other than John,
it is a good lineup.  

I get stuck early, though, as a couple of three outers on the river lay
waste to my quest for poker supremacy.  I scratch my way back, staying
away from tilt and managing to successfully foster my boozehound image
(yeah, like I&rsquo;m faking it&hellip;).  I am down about a hundred and fifty when
some significant lineup changes take place; I should have quit then, but
nobody ever accused me of being smart, and they wouldn&rsquo;t start now.

ActionBob sits down in the 10 seat, in his never-ending quest for
positive EV.  Murray sits in the four seat, immediately to my right;
while I don&rsquo;t fear either of these guys, I certainly respect them.  At
least I have position on one of them.  The game is now seven handed, and
getting tougher.  My inner voice screams at me to leave the game and
seek greener pastures.  I, of course, ignore it, and order another
cocktail.

And then:  The Gavin.

Fresh off his victory in the TOC event, where he won $2880, The Gavin
loudly announces his arrival at the table.  He is, to be delicate,
poop-faced.  And having the time of his life.  He blind-straddles every
hand, and blind three bets when somebody else joins in on the straddle
train.  I raise to isolate whenever I have a half decent hand, but
Murray and ActionBob are wise to this tactic, so isolation is rare.  The
few times my ploy is successful, The Gavin turns a straight, or rivers
two pair, or makes some other miracle to crush me like a small furry
animal.  ActionBob immediately jockeys for the seat immediately to The
Gavin&rsquo;s left.  No flies on Bob.

The Gavin gets into a rather loud disagreement with a local.  The
floorman scolds the local (who is apparently a regular troublemaker),
saying, &ldquo;This man is a BARGE&rsquo;er, and just won a tournament!&rdquo;, and the
local is ejected from the room.  After The Gavin cracks my made hand for
what felt like the six hundredth time, I am stuck 2 racks, and into my
third.  The Gavin finally leaves for bed, as do Murray and ActionBob,
and I continue to play short-handed until 9:30 am, making some headway
through the quagmire, and I manage to leave the game with a loss of
&ldquo;only&rdquo; $480, which feels like a huge victory.

Realizing that, if I sleep now, my chances of waking in time for the
noon No Limit Hold&rsquo;em event are only slightly higher than zero, I return
to the Nugget for a cold shower, listening to Murray snore while I
dress, and set out into the hot Las Vegas morning to seek out breakfast.
The Carson Street Caf has a long lineup.  I stroll to the Las Vegas
Club, recalling someone telling me that their caf is a decent value.

### I&rsquo;M NEVER INVITING MURRAY ANYWHERE AGAIN

Steak and eggs safely put away, I return to the ĪShoe to the tournament
area, where throngs of eager BARGE&rsquo;ers are milling about.  There is a
table just outside of the tournament tables where a lineup has formed; I
wander over to see what the commotion is about.

The commotion, it appears, is warranted.  Seated behind the table is
Jill Ann Spaulding, the Paradise Poker spokesmodel.  She is autographing
photos of herself, posing for pictures and giving away Paradise
promotional poker chips, worth fifty bucks in buy-in bonuses at
Paradise.  Jill Ann has a very large pair of&hellip;eyes, and turns out to be
a pleasant and charming young lady.  Seated on Jill Ann&rsquo;s lap, and
resting his head between her, um, attributes, is a tiny dog.  The dog&rsquo;s
name:  Hold&rsquo;em.

I am absolutely, positively, not making any of this up.

My opening tournament table is, once again, no soft touch.  Seated at my
table, amongst a host of fine players, are Ming Lee and my roommate
Murray &ldquo;Luckbucket&rdquo; Logan, both of whom have position on me.  Other
players of note are Paul &ldquo;PrestoET&rdquo; White, and Bill Chen, both superior
players. Excellent, Smithers.

The table is surprisingly passive.  I manage to steal several blinds
through the first 3 levels, sometimes with actual hands, sometimes
without.  PrestoET is also playing fairly aggressively; I resolve to
stay out of his way.  Murray doubles up early by cracking Bill&rsquo;s aces
with two pair.

Through three levels, I have managed to increase my T1500 starting stack
to about T2200 (or so I thought·more on this in a moment).  Since Murray
doubled up, he has been uncharacteristically quiet, apparently content
to wait for a big hand.  Blinds are 50 and 100, when he open raises
under the gun, making it T400 to go.  It&rsquo;s folded to me on the button.

I have pocket eights.  I know he&rsquo;d make this raise with any medium pair,
and ace-king down to ace-jack.  My sense is he does not have a pair.  I
make it T1700 to go, believing I have another T500 behind, hoping to
pick up the pot right there if my read is good.  Turns out that I only
have T1680, completely misreading my stack size.  He calls after a few
seconds thought, and I know I&rsquo;m screwed.  He wouldn&rsquo;t call a raise of
that size with anything but tens or better, and I know he&rsquo;d lay down AJ
or AQ here, and maybe even AK.

He shows me pocket tens, neither of us improve, and I&rsquo;m out, in what
turns out to be the last hand before the first break.

I&rsquo;ve just traveled fifteen hundred miles to get knocked out of the main
event by a guy from my home game.  Crap.  I feel like Charlie Brown in
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown!&rdquo;:  &ldquo;I got a rock.&rdquo;

I talked to Murray at the break about the hand, and we agreed that it
was a &ldquo;you know that I know that you know...&rdquo; kind of situation.  He
says that, if it was a player unknown to him, he probably would have
laid it down to the re-raise; I tell him, that if the open-raiser was
unknown to me, I don&rsquo;t make that re-raise.  I don&rsquo;t believe my play was
awful, given my knowledge of his play, but I have a nagging suspicion I
still overplayed it.  I wish him luck, and check on my other horses.

The Gavin is out.  So is David Heller.  Oscar is still in, as is Ali.
Still a chance to make some dough out of this, after all.  I run into
Foldem, and wonder aloud if I should play ring games, or take a nap.  He
again provides me with his unique brand of wisdom:  &ldquo;Hell, take a nap.
You know we&rsquo;re gonna be playing cards all night!&rdquo;  Knowing he&rsquo;s right, I
head back to the Nugget for some rare downtime.

### THE VALUE-CHECK AS A WEAPON?  COOL.

Murray wakes me up, dropping the F-Bomb with vigor and regularity as he
enters the room at 5:30 pm.  He has just been knocked out of the
tournament, on the bubble, no less.  He describes his play as stellar,
apparently getting knocked out by relative newbie Caryl Aronson when he
had the best of it.  He is pissed, while at the same time complimenting
Caryl&rsquo;s play up to that point.  I remind him how he comforted me when,
at the Pot of Gold in September of 2002, our roles were reversed:  I had
just been knocked out on the bubble of the final event by Spencer
&ldquo;Zorak&rdquo; Sun when his kings crushed my pocket eights (hmmm&hellip;a pattern?
Nolan Hee knocked me out of an ESCARGOT event in February when I held
the exact same hand&hellip;).  I return the favor, consoling him by telling
him to quit whining, just as he did for me back in September.  That&rsquo;s
what friends are for.

I shower, and we walk across Fremont to the ĪShoe.  Upon entering the
smoky haze, we run into Scott Burrington, one of my bestest BARGE
buddies, and invite him to join us at the banquet.  His eyes dart around
the casino, desperately seeking an out, but he finally reluctantly
agrees to join us.  So we join hands, and skip through the casino
singing &ldquo;Kumbaya&rdquo; together.

The pre-meal cocktail party is hosted by our good friends at Paradise
Poker.  There is plenty of schwag being thrown about, including t-shirts
and Nike golf balls.  We load up on free stuff, and proceed to loading
up on booze.  The lovely Jill Ann Spaulding is also there, autographing
more photos and glad handing with drooling BARGE&rsquo;ers.  I resolve to
bring back an incriminating signed photo, made out to Murray, and to
present it to the angelic Mrs. Murray, Princess Leah, upon my return to
civilian life.  That&rsquo;s what friends are for.

I confess my evil plan to Jill Ann, who then confides in me with a wink
that she also has an evil side.  She says she knows just how to inscribe
the photo.  She writes:  &ldquo;To Murray and Leah:  Thanks so much for the
great 3-way.  Love, Jill Ann.&rdquo;  Not only beautiful, but funny, too.
Just like me.

Foldem announces an ADB group photo to be taken on the stage; thus do I
attend, as a member, my first official ADB function.  I only wish I knew
which one of those bastards kept grabbing my ass while the photos were
being snapped.

We are joined at our banquet table by Ron Nutt, Ali Mohajer and his
beautiful and witty significant other Jing, and The Gavin.  It is a good
mix of folks, and we have a blast.  Chris &ldquo;Jesus&rdquo; Ferguson and Perry
Friedman are at the next table, using spoons to try to catapult sugar
packets into water glasses.  It is a dignified affair.

Dinner is followed by a speech by the esteemed Howard Lederer, who
Foldem introduces as &ldquo;arguably the best poker player in the world
today&rdquo;; I&rsquo;m not about to argue.  Howard is clearly nervous as he begins,
but quickly warms up and slides into an easy, conversational talk with
many valid points.  He talks about what he sees as the biggest mistake
made by limit hold&rsquo;em players:  limping.  He goes on to explain some
important concepts, such as &ldquo;checking for value&rdquo;, and &ldquo;the bluff-call&rdquo;.
It is an informative and entertaining hour.

### MUST-DRINK CHORSE?  IS THERE ANY OTHER KIND?

A sign-up list makes its&rsquo; way around the room, for those wishing to
partake in the madness that is Saturday night at BARGE.  There are lists
for pot-limit, must-drink 4/8 CHORSE, and must-drink/must-straddle 4/8
Chowaha.  Nothing for the faint of heart.  I sign up for the CHORSE, and
head downstairs to see what&rsquo;s what.

I am immediately accosted by a very agitated Cock-Kneed Rebel.  He has
apparently just been barred from the poker room for throwing cards at a
dealer in a 4/8 game, complaining that he was colluded against, there
must have been a second gunman, the Illuminati control the world, and
various other conspiracy theories.  I tell him to simmer down, apologize
to the floor, and I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll let him back in.  He refuses to calm
down, and continues blustering.  I tell him to put the tinfoil back on
his head, and return to the mothership, and walk away as he carries on
with his spittle-flying rage.  I am quickly losing patience with this
clown.

The Saturday night chaos at BARGE is augmented by the Chip Castle
Building Contest, where all game participants are encouraged to
construct weird and wonderful sculptures made entirely of poker chips.
First prize:  a blue five-dollar chip.  As a result, there is always a
run on white one-dollar chips prior to the start of the games; this
night was no different.  When I go to the main cage to purchase a rack
or three of white, I am told there are no more.  This is not misprint: a
Las Vegas casino is out of one-dollar chips.

I sit down in the CHORSE game, and buy a couple of stacks of white from
sympathetic comrades.  Each of them have at least four racks, so it&rsquo;s
not like they couldn&rsquo;t spare them.  Also in the game are Steve
&ldquo;Goldiefish&rdquo; Goldman, Warren Sander, ADB Ploink, ADB tiger123, Mitch
&ldquo;ADB BFB&rdquo; Firestone, Chic &ldquo;Garnischmensch&rdquo; Natkins, The Gavin, ADB
Ploink, and an empty seat that purportedly belongs to Nolan &ldquo;ADB
Darkside&rdquo; Dalla.  Nolan soon appears, grinning like a schoolboy who&rsquo;s
just put a frog down a girl&rsquo;s dress.  He tells us he&rsquo;s just arranged
something, and won&rsquo;t give any more details.  Hmmmm.

The game, as you might imagine, was an ass-kickin&rsquo; affair, with many
blind straddles and blind calls, and even the occasional blind
three-bet.  Every time the action gets to tiger123, he calmly asks the
dealer, &ldquo;How much is to me, sir?  Twelve dollars?&rdquo;, then screams at the
top of his lungs, &ldquo;I RAISE!&rdquo;  Mitch keeps us boozing by throwing in an
elliptical piece of cork with the word &ldquo;drink&rdquo; silkscreened on it, and
screaming &ldquo;DRINK POT!&rdquo;, whereupon every seated player must drink.  Hence
the name of the game.

It&rsquo;s a ton of fun, even though I went through two hundred dollars in a
half hour, playing $4/8.  I relent, and give up my seat to Rick
&ldquo;Zbigniew&rdquo; Bevan, preferring, at least for a while, the relative sanity
of conversation with other non-participants.

Meanwhile, the final table of the No Limit event has been going on for a
couple of hours.  Reports have been coming that Patti Beadles, Tom
&ldquo;Rebuy&rdquo; Goodwin, and Johnny Davis, all fine players, are playing well
and accumulating chips, but Paul Person is proving to be a thorn in
their collective side.  Soon we hear of the bustouts of Rebuy and Johnny
D, leaving Paul and Patti in a headsup duel for the championship.

There is a long pause now at the final table; spectators look around in
confusion.  Then, all of a sudden, poker room manager Tony Shelton
appears with a cardboard box.  He is accompanied by a stone-faced
security guard, toting a shotgun.  The prize money is being ceremonially
paraded to the final table, just like the tradition at the World Series
of Poker!  This, apparently, is the surprise alluded to earlier by Nolan
Dalla, and what a surprise it was.  BARGE&rsquo;ers around the room are
roaring with laughter, your faithful reporter being no exception.  The
money is dumped in a pile on the table: it is $3180 in one dollar bills.
Unbelievable.

Paul eventually prevails over Patti and takes home the cash and the
hardware.  Well done, Mr. Person, a fine champion you are.  And, of
course, if Mr. Person is unable to carry out his duties as BARGE
No-Limit Hold&rsquo;em Champion, then the crown will revert to Ms. Beadles for
the duration of the term.

Perhaps foolishly, I get a seat in the $1/2 blind mixed Omaha/Hold&rsquo;em
game, surrounded by such weak players as Len Greenberg, Barry Kornspan,
ADB Jaeger, Bret &ldquo;Maverick&rdquo; Roth, Andrew &ldquo;Andrew&rdquo; Prock, ADB Ploink, and
my arch-nemesis Murray Logan.  I play for about 3 hours, managing to
escape with a $20 loss, which I consider a victory.  I spend most of the
time trading barbs with Mr. Prock, who tries nearly every hand to peek
at my hole cards.  I say, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a prick, Prock,&rdquo; about every three
minutes, believing these to be the funniest words I have ever uttered.
As usual, it is a fun table.

Hand of note:  Omaha round, Murray needs to use the men&rsquo;s room, and
allows a very drunk The Gavin to play his chips.  After some pre-flop
raising, The Gavin finds himself heads-up with Len Greenberg.  Len bets
out on the flop.  The Gavin pushes all of Murray&rsquo;s chips forward, going
all in.  Len ponders for a few minutes.  The Gavin says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you
half my hand,&rdquo; and turns over a pair of deuces, which in no way
coordinates with the board.  After a few more seconds, Len folds.  I ask
The Gavin later what he had, and he says, &ldquo;A pair of deuces.&rdquo;  Murray
later relates that The Gavin told him he had the nuts.  It&rsquo;s anybody&rsquo;s
guess.

I decide to try the pits one more time.  I find some BARGE&rsquo;ers at a
craps table, and I happily join the game.  It is not a good run; I drop
about $250 until ADB Jester rattles of a five minute roll, and I recoup
about $100.  While at the table, who should appear behind me, to my
great annoyance, but The Cock-Kneed Rebel.  His head is curiously devoid
of tin foil:  he has not heeded my earlier advice.

He tells me that Murray has told him where to find me.  Note to self:
kick Murray&rsquo;s sorry ass.  The Rebel is now obviously in search of a
handout, which I do not provide.  I tell him I&rsquo;m going to the men&rsquo;s
room, and to wait for me at the craps table.  I leave with no intention
of returning.

I head to a blackjack table, and make about $180 playing two squares;
there is a young couple from Los Angeles at the table, who ask my advice
on several hands.  The advice turns out to be profitable for them, and
we are laughing often. There is a lovely young apprentice dealer named
Mandi, with whom I flirt shamelessly, and, to my delight, she
reciprocates.  Life is good.  I lose back a hundred or so at another
blackjack table, and decide to call it a night.

It is now approaching 6:00 am.  Once again, I am drunk, happy, and
exhausted.  As I leave the pit area, I am once again accosted by the
Cock-Kneed Rebel, who is now desperate for twenty bucks.  He tells me he
is making a remake of &ldquo;A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Forum&rdquo;.
Seriously, that&rsquo;s what he said.  I tell him, in a loud voice, to at
least come up with a decent story, and to leave me the hell alone.  It
was quite sad, actually.

Then, I run into Mandi the cute dealer, and manage to get an email
address from her.  This later turns out to be fake.  It was also quite
sad, actually.

Our plane leaves at 2:30 pm.  I wander (stagger?) back to the poker
room, saying goodbye to, and shaking hands with, anyone who&rsquo;d speak with
me.  I&rsquo;m sure I said goodbye to several of the janitorial staff, and the
shoeshine guy, as well; there may have been a few BARGE&rsquo;ers I spoke
with, too.  I vaguely remember falling safely into bed at 6:30, and
waking at 12:30 to Murray shaking me violently.  We shuffle to checkout,
and fall into a waiting cab.

Thanks to the generosity of Chic Natkins and his fiancé allowing us to
cut in front of them in the security check lineup, we make our plane by
two minutes.  We trade stories the entire flight home; Murray tells me
this has been the most fun he&rsquo;s ever had doing anything, anytime,
anywhere.  Who am I to disagree?  It was terrific, the best *ARG event I
have attended to date.

The BARGE dynamic is difficult to describe, even though I&rsquo;ve just taken
a million words to try.  I can&rsquo;t recall being part of any group, at any
time in my life, that has such a sense of community, of brotherhood, and
of trust.  Can&rsquo;t wait to see you all again.  Even you, Prock.

I&rsquo;ll be back.  You can bet on it.  Why don&rsquo;t you join us?

Respectfully submitted,

### EPILOGUE:  IN APPRECIATION

Binion&rsquo;s Horseshoe:  Despite some unfortunate public-relations mishaps
in the past few years, Binion&rsquo;s ownership and management has shown time
and time again that they not only understand the mayhem that is BARGE,
they welcome and embrace it each and every year.  I can&rsquo;t think of
another property that would even come close to treating us as well as
the ĪShoe.  Thanks so much for your continued support of this chaotic
yet uncontrollable event.

Peter &ldquo;Foldem&rdquo; Secor, Chuck Weinstock, and Michael &ldquo;KidZee&rdquo; Zimmers:

you, Mike; come back soon.

true pleasure.  You gained a lot of fans that night.

Binion&rsquo;s Staff:  While every Binion&rsquo;s employee I had contact with
treated me like visiting royalty, there are several who deserve special
mention:  Dealers Tommy, Mike, and Christina; cocktail waitresses Mary
Ann and Lisa; floorman Mark, and poker room manager Tony Shelton:  You
all went out of your way to make us feel at home, and I&rsquo;m here to tell
you it worked.  You are all a credit to your professions, and to your
employer.  Thanks so much for enhancing the BARGE experience.

BARGE Buddies, new and old:  I love you all, and can&rsquo;t possibly mention
everyone who contributed to making this such a fabulous event for me.

Finally, I&rsquo;d like to thank my good home game buddies Murray Logan and

hell it was I&rsquo;ve been raving about since August 2001.  Now you know,
boys; now you know.
