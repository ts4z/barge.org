  The pit boss is like in my lap. ...
  When count gets to -2 I just sit out the rest of the deck and order
  another drink.  I wonder if they have my picture or they just sweat more than
  me jogging in LV.

Get to LV on Tuesday night.  Decide to stay a few days on the strip to play
some poker at the bellagio and maybe some BJ before heading downtown for Barge
madness.  When I get to the IP (barge tradition to stay at cheap hotel without
wife) there is a huge line.  I just check my bags and head to mirage to play
some BJ.  The MGM has suggested in the past I don't play 21 so I have to keep
sessions to short and move a lot.  I play about 45m at $25-200 and win $900.  I
then walk through the bellagio.  I have often played in their $50 game here but
tonight all 8 tables of DD are $100 with nobody playing.  I leave and go to
Aria and find the same thing of all DD tables being $100.  I should have
brought more money as in past trips $50 tables were always available and that
is what the CBJN report said.

I head to the palace station.  They have a DD where they deal 75-80% of the
cards.  Not as good of rules but I only come to vegas 1-2x per yer so I decide
$10-200 is acceptable here.  I had 2 beers at the airport and 2 on the plane
and 2-3 at the mirage.  I get to the Palace station around 1:00 am.  I buy in
for $500 and the pit boss comes to talk to me.  Most players are betting
$10-15.  I start with $50 bets and adjust.  I order 2-3 drinks and start
playing.  Buy 2:30 I have had 7-8 drinks and I am up $1000 or so.  There is a
pit boss camped at my table now.  I could care less.  Next round I bet $40 on
the first hand and I get 20 and dealer has an Ace.  No insurance (of course).
Later in the deck I see 11 small cards come out on one round heads up and I
adjust my bet from $75->250.  I order another shot and beer (I have 2 shots and
1.5 beers in front of me).  I get 16 and the dealer has an A so I take
insurance and she has it.  I figure the end is near but what the hell.  My
drinks come and I now have 5 on the table.  The casino manager comes over and
says no more BJ.  He also mentions that he had not seen someone drink sooo much
and still play a tough game.  Been in vegas 6h and up $2400 total, pretty
buzzed/drunk, and 1 barring.  I play until 6:00 am at the TI and Mirage.  When
I get to the IP there is no line and they ask me if I am checking out, I say no
in.  Totally forgot to get my bags and just head to the room to crash.  Pretty
drunk by 6:00 when I go to bed.  Forgot to drink any water, bad idea.

Wake up on Wednesday and go running.  I broke the cardinal rule of not drinking
8 glasses of water before bed.  As I am jogging down LVB towards the El Cortez
I think I have some minor stomach convulsions.  I go into the stratosphere and
drink 5-6 glasses of water.  I then play some BJ at the Bellagio before Steve W
gets to town with John.  I find the $50 table at the high limit area is open.
I love this room.  They have a private bartender.  I am the only one playing so
I play it cool at $50-250.  I order some fine wine from France.  Of course I
would be ok with Charles Schwab.  I sign a few markers (3 to be exact) and
mostly lose in here.  You do have to be pretty mellow if you are a small bettor
(anything under $1k is small).  They move all tables to $100 but let me play.
I leave and play some BJ at the Aria before I need to meet Steve at the
Bellagio poker room.  We play some 4-8.  We are drinking double pineapple stoli
drinks pretty fast.  We all move to the 10-20 game and notice we are the only
players drinking.  We play until about 2:00.  Steve goes to bed and John and I
head to the mirage for some late night BJ.  The $25 game is empty so we sit
down.  Not sure if I can count after 20 drinks but I give it a shot.  Counting
isn't the problem but dealer 5 card 21s is.  The count goes up and up and I am
down $1000 in one shuffle.  We lose every hand.  I decide that maybe I have had
too much to drink to play BJ correctly and head to bed around 4:00.

Thursday after running we played at the Venetian 4-8 game.  Saw bargers playing
8-16 O/8 but friends want to play HE.  Can't get a 8/16 game going.
I leave early to play some BJ at the Mirage.  Bellagio again only had all $100
tables.  After giving back most of my BJ winnings we play 10/20 at the
Bellagio.  This is really a rock garden game.  Steve W finds out you can order
12y Macallan at the table and has 3.  I am on drink 15+ so I stick with mixed
drinks.  I think I play until 3:30 or so and even play a few rounds of 3
handed.  I moved up to a 20-40 game that was even more rocky.  I never played
the 40/80 game this trip but the other games were very marginal.

Friday we head down to the 4Q and checkin.  I do my usual I suck at tournaments
and end up about mid pack in the TOC.  All I remember was drinking 5-6 beers
before I go.  That afternoon I played a ruling 4/8 horse game.  The bet that
Dave F made about the stack of chips had me laughing so hard I couldn't take
it.  The part about his being jewish and the line was 5s was really funny.  I
paid Dave my $2 for the over and was the funniest time ever for $2.  I think I
donked off 2 racks playing 4/8 horse.  A bunch of us went to the brewery at
Main Street for dinner.  North Shore Mike paid off some of my aresenal/man U
bets with dinner/drinks.  Beer is really good here.  Tom Hummel is a master
home brewer I hear and even he liked it.  I had 3 I think to bring my total to
15 or so for the day.  After dinner I head back to the shoe and play 6/12 HO.
Bingo, Mav, and some others are here.  I am really drunk by now so I decide to
only have 5 doubles before I head to bed.  Mav is in best behavior and we sit
next to each other and have an enjoyable time.  One funny hand I flop the nut
flush on O8 against Bingo and some all ins.  The pot is huge and I have 2nd nut
low draw also.  Board pairs a 7 on the river.  Bingo who has been calling the
whole way fires 12 into the pot.  I ask him if he will show me one card for $1.
He agrees and I turn over a 7.  I assumed he had a set but this was enough to
fold a $250 pot so I save the $11 call.  Bingo shows the other 7.  We all
laugh.  Mav then runs super hot against me and wins something like 7 hands in a
row with &ldquo;commerce outs&rdquo; as he puts it.  Some hands had 2 outs
others had 15+.  Mav was cool about it and I drop $200 in the game.

Saturday I again play OK until the blinds move up.  I have to wear my German
jersey for paying off a Euro 2012 soccer bet with Bingo.  What an ugly $100
uniform but I couldn't lose to a nicer guy.  I give him the jersey that night
to take home and wish him bad beats when he wears it.  I decide AQ is good
enough for a raise of about 40% of my stack.  Ice goes all in and he has AK and
I go home now.  I truly play AQ like a limit player who has been drinking in
tourneys.  I win last longer bets against Steve and John so that is cool.
Steve and I go to Texas Station to play some poker and me some BJ.  The game is
2-6 spread with a 1/2 kill.  Later it becomes NL with over buttons though
nobody has more than $150 on the table.  First time I have every played limit
with NL over buttons.  I get bored and go play some BJ.  I sit down and start
losing at the $10-150 range.  The pit boss is like in my lap.  I go down about
$400 in 5m and then hit a card rush.  Parlay a $25 bet into $150 when a split
and double wins.  I hear &ldquo;shuffle&rdquo; from the boss to the dealer at
about 1d left when they normally deal to 1/2 deck.  Next round I bet $10 on the
top.  When count gets to -2 I just sit out the rest of the deck and order
another drink.  I wonder if they have my picture or they just sweat more than
me jogging in LV.  After 1h or so we leave and I am up $900.  When we get back
downtown Steve and I go to the El Cortez to play BJ.  I decide I will sit at
their SD and bet $10 on the top and either $5 on the next round or $100-125.
The new dealer looks really nervous the first time I slam $125 in 5 chips on
the felt.  Some rounds I just sit out on bad counts.  The pit boss is watching
but nothing happens.  I make about 6 large bets expecting the tap at anytime.
I at least get a few more beers.  We leave for the banquet and I am even and
Steve wins $100 or so.  Banquet was great and Un's song was the nuts.  I am now
officially an ADB and lose $40 on the last longer bets.  Go figure!!!  Drinkers
against Math Experts!!  We play 4/8 horse.  I go on a major rush and scoop many
Omaha hands including one with quads that Steve has AA.  I also sucked out on
QB when playing my double gutter pretty fast.  I end up around $350 for the
game at around 2:30 I really need to sleep for the 7:50 flight to Seattle.

Played poker at Diamond Lils this week.  Game is definitely +EV but the
players, fun atmosphere, environment is 10x worse than barge.  I book a small
win and think I would be better served playing 4/8 at Barge.  Thanks to
everyone for making barge great as ever!  Can't wait until January for Embargo.

They don't have a picture, but this was posted to the Pit Boss forums last week under the "Card Counters Forum":
