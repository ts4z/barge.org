I had planned to get to Vegas on Tuesday night and stay 3 nights at the =0A=
mirage and 2 nights downtown.  I had some work stuff come up that made =0A=
leaving on Tuesday out of question.  I moved the flight to Wednesday =0A=
morning.  I called the  mirage and changed my reservation.  =0A=
Luckily I did that as otherwise they had only booked the room for Tuesday a=
nd =0A=
Wednesday.  I had a 3 room comp offer I had used so I have no idea how they=
 =0A=
only booked 2 nights.  I meet Steve at the airport and we catch a =0A=
cab.  There is a long checkin line (looks like 15m).  I never check in =0A=
if there is a line and just leave my bags and get a key around 4-5am.  =0A=
Steve doesn=92t like this plan so we wait.  I could have played some BJ and=
 =0A=
had a drink while waiting.  I plan my Barge trip all year.  I had =0A=
meant to bring my ADB hat and Alcohol Hawk for BAC testing.  I also left my=
 =0A=
bust out gift (some smoked salmon from Seattle) on my bed.  At least I have=
 =0A=
my bankroll.  I used 2 SW free drink coupons on the plane so I am +2 beer u=
nits before we hit the strip.

While Steve puts our bags in the room I head to the =0A=
tables.  I am going to play some BJ today.  Steve plays at mirage =0A=
poker room.  I find a $25 game and get a $1k marker.  I play for about =0A=
3-4h.  At one point steve and John walk up and I order a round of patron =
=0A=
shots.  They aren=92t even playing but no problem they say.  I had 5-6 =0A=
beers and then we go eat dinner at the Pizza kitchen.  I have a comp.  =0A=
Steve gets a $10 newcastle beer.   When the check comes I sign the =0A=
comp.  I think both Steve and John thought I was adding a tip but I didn=92=
t =0A=
and you can=92t tip with comp points that I am aware of.  After dinner I he=
ad =0A=
over the HL room to play some more BJ.  The $100 table is open so I sit =0A=
down and get a $2k marker.  I lose that in about 10m and then sign another =
=0A=
one.   If you want to drink/gambol the HL rooms in vegas are =0A=
great.  They have a private bartender and you just ask for a drink and the =
=0A=
pit calls and it shows up.  I order a few more parton shots and start =0A=
drinking double stoli/cran drinks.  About 11:00 or so John comes over and =
=0A=
plays a few hands.  I think he bought in for $100 and plays a few =0A=
hands.  I bet all of my remaining chips and have to split and double.  =0A=
I was going to take another marker but they haven=92t process my other ones=
 so I =0A=
pull out $2k and  buy chips.  I win both hands when the dealer =0A=
busts.  I start to win and build up some chips.  I decide to not stack =0A=
my chips but put them in a pile.  I am betting between 100-800 with wild =
=0A=
bet changes.  I often bet rainbows of black/green/red/blue saying it is goo=
d =0A=
luck.  The casino hosts who comped dinner comes by at 1 and is shocked I am=
 =0A=
still playing (3h later) and have 2-3 drinks on the table.  I have been in =
=0A=
vegas for about 8 hours and I have had 10-15 drinks and bought $7k in chips=
 so =0A=
he leaves a card.  John finally loses his chips and goes to bed.  I =0A=
was going to play until 3 and then hit the palace station where I was barre=
d at =0A=
last Barge and the pit boss posted the story on the forum.  Out of nowhere =
=0A=
that I could see the casino manager is behind me @ 2:30.  I just finished =
=0A=
another shot when I hear=2C =93Mr Christensen=94.  This doesn=92t sound lik=
e the =0A=
bartender.  She says she is the casino manager and I am flat bet for =0A=
BJ.  I tell her I am too drunk and need to go to bed anyhow.  =93Good =0A=
night=94 she says.  I get back my markers and leave with $1.8k in chips or =
up =0A=
$800 for the day.  I had played at Bellagio=2C and Monte Carlo in February =
=0A=
with no heat at $100 tables.  Maybe too much time is my problem.  Oh=2C =0A=
well I can=92t play at MGM with my card anymore or =0A=
credit.  I actually just head to bed as I probably have had enough to drink=
 for one day.
I get up Thursday and go jogging.  I have to drink water at a few casinos a=
s I job from the Mirage to near downtown and then come back.  I play 15/30 =
O8 at the Venetian and lose chips slowly for $375 loss.  I then head over t=
o the Bellagio and play some 20/40 HE for about 3-4h.  I lose almost every =
pot.  I see one player who is winning and she is playing every hand.  Old B=
ellagio players are berating here on every suckout.  I have AA and 3 bet pr=
e-flop and bet the flop of: q-4-2 - she calls6 - she calls6 - she check rai=
ses me
She said 6h8h is her favorite hand.  Old local mentions can you believe tha=
t sh#$&.  I laugh and love her playing that way.  I dump $890 in this game =
only winning 2 small pots.=20

We have dinner at the noodle bar.  Casino manager was nice enough not to ch=
arge for room or take away my comp points.  I mention to Steve and John to =
make sure they leave a tip.  =3B-)  After dinner they head back to Mirage t=
o play 1-3.  I put my name on the 20/40 list which is quite long and only 1=
 40/80 doesn't look to inviting as even I know most of the players.  I deci=
de to play/drink some more.  I catch a cab to the Orleans.  They have the l=
ucky ladies sidebet.  I check Stanford wong's CBJN before I leave.  I love =
this side bet.  In seattle you can be up to $300 at any point.  This is a t=
otal sucker bet but it can get to +10% edge around 5% of the time and you d=
on't have to be it every hand.  I get to the Orleans and see a sign that sa=
ys max side bet is $25.  I usually bet $300 on BJ and $150-300 on the side =
bet.  Orleans is fairly empty but they do have video poker with Newcastle o=
n tap.  I play $20 and order 2 20oz beers.  I win $20 at VP and head to the=
 BJ pits.  I buyin for $500 and plan to play $25-300 and maybe $400 as that=
 is what they can usually handle.  I win a little over $1100 when I get 2 B=
Js in a row with $150 and then $250 on them.  The penetration is really odd=
 here.  Some dealers deal only 1d others are dealing 1.5d.  I am pretty sur=
e the casino policy is to cutoff .7 of a deck.  I swing by the video poker =
bar and play 3 hands of VP and get another pint of beer.  I can't quite fin=
ish before the cab comes but give my glass to the valet parker as I get int=
o the cab.  I decide to head back to the Palace Station.  This place really=
 is a dump but they do have the 8th rated BJ game in las vegas using the sc=
ore system.  I plan to stick to the $25/200 ratio here as this places reall=
y sweats all action and they barred me last year in 2.5h when I had 13 drin=
ks in that time period. =20

I get a big count right away and bet $175.  I get 66 and split against a 3.=
  Another 6 comes out.  I end up with 3 16s and dealer has 13 and gets 23. =
 I see pit boss head right to the phone.  Count is down so I bet $25 and he=
 comes back to look at that.  I could care less about this dump so I will j=
ust play for a bit.  I see 2 more pit bosses come over.  I have been here l=
ess than 15m.  I decide to flat bet.  I initially ordered a shot and beer. =
 When boss comes by I order a black coffee and a mineral water.  I realize =
I have the same Man U jersey and hat as last year.  I notice the dealer has=
 moved the cut card up to 1d instead of the station casino normal .5d polic=
y.  I flat bet for 15m with bosses standing right there.  When I color up t=
he casino manager walks over and mentions I am barred from BJ.  He respects=
 me trying to make a living playing 21 but not to come back and keep it pro=
fessional.  I don't say much and just leave.  I guess I was too noticeable =
last year?  (Who would have thought so) It is 4:00 and I cab back to the Mi=
rage.

We head downtown on Friday morning in time for the tourney.  TOC is may fav=
orite tourney but I just don't get many hands. I do make a steel wheel when=
 I am all in but only get 3/4 of the pot.  LOL.  I never have more than sta=
rting chips and when I do get my hands on I am always 2nd best.  I bust out=
 early and I owe John=2C Steve=2C and Oliver buffet at the GN.
The only highly rated BJ game downtown is at the El Cortez.  Since you can'=
t find poker games that I like downtown I will play some BJ and then come b=
ack for the $500 hoser event.  At the El Cortez we are playing pretty crazy=
.  Bets ranging from $10-300.  John and I do pretty good.  I get blackjacks=
 on a bunch of hands and end up winning $1400 before we need to meet Oliver=
 for dinner.  Steve is still in the tournament by some very bad beats he pe=
rformed I would guess (LOL).  After dinner I play some 4/8 HO.  I tell myse=
lf I will try and play normal but when I play 4/8 I just end up straddling=
=2C going for suckouts=2C and not really playing poker.  Nothing new at thi=
s game and I lose $70 before time for the hoser tourney. =20

I made last longer bets with Bill Chen and David Kluchman for $100 each.  D=
ave is a no-show for this event so I have booked a $100 bet against what I =
would imagine is by some margin the best player against the only player dri=
nking consistently here.  This tourney was a lot of fun.  I notice the leve=
l of play was quite high form my estimation.  Everyone was positive and fun=
ny.  I sit next to Bill for quite a bit of the tourney and Sabyl.  In the m=
iddle I pick up some good O8 hands.  I don't play any Razz hands other than=
 blind steals.  We play hose as nobody likes Razz and HO is my most common =
game.  When we get down to 1 table I get another pretty good hand when I ha=
ve AA2 split and Kenny has split kings and neither of us improve and win a =
pretty nice pot.  Bill has a cold run of cards and ends up 4th.  I can't re=
member who came in 3rd but I somehow luckbox into 2nd.  Scott Byron has abo=
ut 85% of the chips or more.  Even when I am all in with a pretty good draw=
 if I scoop I would only have 25% or so.  But I don't hit on 2 cards and I =
get 2nd.  I hope this tournament happens each year as I would play every ye=
ar.  From what I saw I had more beer than all other 16 players combined bet=
ween 8-2.  I think about bed but decide to play 2-3h more at the El Cortez.=
  I win another $300 but only have 2 more beers before bed time.  This is f=
irst Friday and between El Cortez and 4Q I see 15 cop cars and lots of arre=
sts.  A cop takes my beer saying these 2 blocks you can't drink.  I have ha=
d 15+ beers so no problem officer as I stumble home.   I am too worn out to=
 even run on Saturday.  I get to the tourney just in time and find David He=
ller is at my table.  Only 2 players from Seattle area play right next to e=
ach other.  David helped consult my on my legal standing when an Indian cas=
ino in Seattle backroomed me by force and was going to keep my cash/chips. =
 He also is a former Barge champion.  The table was fun and I get to remind=
 ADB BigBoy the home brew he promised me for some software discounts has no=
t arrived in Seattle and Bruce promises to make good.  I don't get too many=
 hands and bleed off some chips while drinking a few beers.  I get moved to=
 a new table and shortly I pickup KK with about 2.3k left.  I raise and Nic=
k calls from the SB.  Bob herlein goes all-in.  I can raise all in and Nick=
 calls. Nick- Q10 (I think but definitely a Q)Bob - A8me - KK
Flop Qxx=2C turn Q (I go home now)=2C river x

I see that Nick hit the money so he did better than I probably would have w=
ith the only 2 bargers with that sounding last name.  I had beat Nick on a =
total suckout on O8 tourney at Embargo to win eventually=2C so I get it.  N=
ick is a great guy also though needs to working on drinking form with that =
last name!  I do win my gold for goldie bet and it is nice when he is at yo=
ur table so you just collect on the spot.  I also gave $50 to Peter for som=
e ADB last longer bet.  Given that I am the main member of the "D" team I h=
ave no idea what I paid for or if I get any return.  I have played at every=
 Barge since 1994 (luxor) and never cashed.  That could be a record in and =
of itself.  So many drinks so few cashes.   John and I eat at the Binnions =
bullpen.  Michael Maurer joins us and we can use up all of John's comp poin=
ts from playing poker.  We are heading back to the El Cortez before banquet=
.  Steve will join us soon.  When Steve gets there we start drinking pretty=
 heavily.  We want to order Patron shots.  The waitress says they don't hav=
e that.  I know they do you just have to get a boss permission.  We talk to=
 pat a young PB and he knows I am already in $1300 so he approves it.  We k=
eep ordering round after round of patron.  After the 3rd round a 25y old su=
permodel shows up with a 45-50 man.  He is playing 2 hands as $10 and gave =
her $60 to play $10 a hand.  She is really flirting the part and obviously =
exposing her assets to everyone around including us and the older man.  The=
 gentlemen gets up a few times for 20m and then comes back.   Steve and I t=
alk quietly about their situation.  We assume she is a paid escort.  After =
they leave the pit boss comes to talk to us.  She wants to know what we sai=
d.  We mention maybe she was working.  The female pit boss says he came in =
with another women and was playing back and forth at 2 tables with them.  I=
 am now thinking if this was an escort why bring them to the El Cortez?  Wh=
at do you drink more than me.  We also see Michael at the Cortez.  They hav=
e some ATM rebate deal he has figured out is +EV.  I skip that and keep pla=
ying.  The 4th and 5th round of patron shots arrive.  I am working my way t=
o almost even.  When the 5th round arrives Steve spills the whole thing.  P=
atron running all over the table.  Some patron ends up in the discard tray.=
  Cards standing in a puddle of patron.  I would have taken a picture if th=
ey allowed that.  When I turn to ask the waitress for a towel Steve pounds =
my shot.  WTF?  We laugh.  We decide to leave.  Steve and I get lost and en=
d up at craps.  We roll so many 7s I lose $750 in 15m (I am so drunk I thin=
k I bet yo=2C horn=2C hardways=2C hop bets) but only 7s roll.   As we are l=
eaving the casino manager asks where we are going and will we be back.  (Fu=
nny when I left the Mirage and Palace Station they didn't seem to care I wa=
s leaving) We txt John we will be at the banquet around 6:30 and hold a sea=
t.  I mostly drink water and for the first time in my life I had no drinks =
at dinner at Barge.  I am pretty drunk during the banquet that I can't here=
 my name in the song but I was told it was there. =20
I talk to Bozo during dinner looking at pictures.  He mentions he wants to =
play in my 4/8 game.  I am not sure that was a compliment.  I also complime=
nt him in person for his total destruction of me on the exact electoral col=
lege votes last fall.  I remind him how bad the country is because of that =
but I am not sure he agreed or I didn't slurrrrr my speech so bad he couldn=
't understand WTF I was saying. I wish Northshore good look at the final ta=
ble.  He is the only guy who likes soccer/beer as much as me!    After dinn=
er we play some more at the Cortez.  I have bought a cigar and we share it.=
  Dealer can't believe this.  We have known each other 22 years and we are =
so drunk we don't care.  We order Patron shots (of course).  The new waitre=
ss says we can't have any here.  I ask the pit boss he says=2C "Hell=2C the=
y had 50 this afternoon why would I cut them off now".  We laugh really har=
d.  This is the same table where Steve spilled earlier and you can see/smel=
l the tequilla.  LOL  He sits down and talks to us.  He pretends to give us=
 advice like taking even money on BJ with a 8 up and standing on 4-3 so you=
 don't take the bust card.  We laugh.  We are more moderate after dinner an=
d only have 3 more shots and 4-5 double drinks.  I was in $1500 and then st=
art winning.  I have $2k in black chips before I know it.  By 1:30 I am pre=
tty drunk and kind of tired.  4th night in Vegas can be like that.  I tell =
steve one more good count we jack up our bets and then leave.  They have qu=
it calling our checks play.  Earlier even if I bet $100+ they would call ch=
ecks play.  I bet 2 hands at $245 each and steve bets 2x$175.  I use to see=
 Steve only bet $50 max.  I almost fall out of my chair (for at least 2 rea=
sons).  We get 4 stiff hands.  Dealer has a 10.  I hit A-4 and get a 6 to p=
ush on the hand.  All of the rest bust.  I win $650 and steve loses $350 or=
 so.   Overall barge is great every year.  Sorry to see some old friends pa=
ss away and some who don't return.  I always enjoy when a barger comes to S=
eattle and we play poker or have a drink (or two).  I also notice when I ge=
t home that I have $8 in chips from Binnions so I have to come back for Emb=
argo.  I am starting my usual 30d post barge on the wagon program.  (Don't =
laugh last year I made it 8d)   Monte

Old Bellagio players are berating here on every suckout.&nbsp=3B I have AA =

 charge for room or take away my comp points.&nbsp=3B I mention to Steve an=
d John to make sure they leave a tip.&nbsp=3B =3B-)&nbsp=3B After dinner th=
ey head back to Mirage to play 1-3.&nbsp=3B I put my name on the 20/40 list=
 which is quite long and only 1 40/80 doesn't look to inviting as even I kn=
ow most of the players.&nbsp=3B I decide to play/drink some more.&nbsp=3B I=
 catch a cab to the Orleans.&nbsp=3B They have the lucky ladies sidebet.&nb=
sp=3B I check Stanford wong's CBJN before I leave.&nbsp=3B I love this side=
 bet.&nbsp=3B In seattle you can be up to $300 at any point.&nbsp=3B This i=
s a total sucker bet but it can get to +10% edge around 5% of the time and =
you don't have to be it every hand.&nbsp=3B I get to the Orleans and see a =
sign that says max side bet is $25.&nbsp=3B I usually bet $300 on BJ and $1=
50-300 on the side bet.&nbsp=3B Orleans is fairly empty but they do have vi=
deo poker with Newcastle on tap.&nbsp=3B I play $20 and order 2 20oz beers.=
&nbsp=3B I win $20 at VP and head to the BJ pits.&nbsp=3B I buyin for $500 =
and plan to play $25-300 and maybe $400 as that is what they can usually ha=
ndle.&nbsp=3B I win a little over $1100 when I get 2 BJs in a row with $150=
 and then $250 on them.&nbsp=3B The penetration is really odd here.&nbsp=3B=
 Some dealers deal only 1d others are dealing 1.5d.&nbsp=3B I am pretty sur=
e the casino policy is to cutoff .7 of a deck.&nbsp=3B I swing by the video=
 poker bar and play 3 hands of VP and get another pint of beer.&nbsp=3B I c=
an't quite finish before the cab comes but give my glass to the valet parke=
r as I get into the cab.&nbsp=3B I decide to head back to the Palace Statio=
n.&nbsp=3B This place really is a dump but they do have the 8th rated BJ ga=
me in las vegas using the score system.&nbsp=3B I plan to stick to the $25/=
200 ratio here as this places really sweats all action and they barred me l=
ast year in 2.5h when I had 13 drinks in that time period.&nbsp=3B <br><br>=
I get a big count right away and bet $175.&nbsp=3B I get 66 and split again=
st a 3.&nbsp=3B Another 6 comes out.&nbsp=3B I end up with 3 16s and dealer=
 has 13 and gets 23.&nbsp=3B I see pit boss head right to the phone.&nbsp=
=3B Count is down so I bet $25 and he comes back to look at that.&nbsp=3B I=
 could care less about this dump so I will just play for a bit.&nbsp=3B I s=
ee 2 more pit bosses come over.&nbsp=3B I have been here less than 15m.&nbs=
p=3B I decide to flat bet.&nbsp=3B I initially ordered a shot and beer.&nbs=
p=3B When boss comes by I order a black coffee and a mineral water.&nbsp=3B=
 I realize I have the same Man U jersey and hat as last year.&nbsp=3B I not=
ice the dealer has moved the cut card up to 1d instead of the station casin=
o normal .5d policy.&nbsp=3B I flat bet for 15m with bosses standing right =
there.&nbsp=3B When I color up the casino manager walks over and mentions I=
 am barred from BJ.&nbsp=3B He respects me trying to make a living playing =
21 but not to come back and keep it professional.&nbsp=3B I don't say much =
and just leave.&nbsp=3B I guess I was too noticeable last year?&nbsp=3B (Wh=
o would have thought so) It is 4:00 and I cab back to the Mirage.<br><br>We=
 head downtown on Friday morning in time for the tourney.&nbsp=3B TOC is ma=
y favorite tourney but I just don't get many hands. I do make a steel wheel=
 when I am all in but only get 3/4 of the pot.&nbsp=3B LOL.&nbsp=3B I never=
 have more than starting chips and when I do get my hands on I am always 2n=
d best.&nbsp=3B I bust out early and I owe John=2C Steve=2C and Oliver buff=
et at the GN.</div><div><br>The only highly rated BJ game downtown is at th=
e El Cortez.&nbsp=3B Since you can't find poker games that I like downtown =
I will play some BJ and then come back for the $500 hoser event.&nbsp=3B At=
 the El Cortez we are playing pretty crazy.&nbsp=3B Bets ranging from $10-3=
00.&nbsp=3B John and I do pretty good.&nbsp=3B I get blackjacks on a bunch =
of hands and end up winning $1400 before we need to meet Oliver for dinner.=
&nbsp=3B Steve is still in the tournament by some very bad beats he perform=
ed I would guess (LOL).&nbsp=3B After dinner I play some 4/8 HO.&nbsp=3B I =
tell myself I will try and play normal but when I play 4/8 I just end up st=
raddling=2C going for suckouts=2C and not really playing poker.&nbsp=3B Not=
hing new at this game and I lose $70 before time for the hoser tourney.&nbs=
p=3B <br><br>I made last longer bets with Bill Chen and David Kluchman for =
$100 each.&nbsp=3B Dave is a no-show for this event so I have booked a $100=
 bet against what I would imagine is by some margin the best player against=
 the only player drinking consistently here.&nbsp=3B This tourney was a lot=
 of fun.&nbsp=3B I notice the level of play was quite high form my estimati=
on.&nbsp=3B Everyone was positive and funny.&nbsp=3B I sit next to Bill for=
 quite a bit of the tourney and Sabyl.&nbsp=3B In the middle I pick up some=
 good O8 hands.&nbsp=3B I don't play any Razz hands other than blind steals=
.&nbsp=3B We play hose as nobody likes Razz and HO is my most common game.&=
nbsp=3B When we get down to 1 table I get another pretty good hand when I h=
ave AA2 split and Kenny has split kings and neither of us improve and win a=
 pretty nice pot.&nbsp=3B Bill has a cold run of cards and ends up 4th.&nbs=
p=3B I can't remember who came in 3rd but I somehow luckbox into 2nd.&nbsp=
=3B Scott Byron has about 85% of the chips or more.&nbsp=3B Even when I am =
all in with a pretty good draw if I scoop I would only have 25% or so.&nbsp=
=3B But I don't hit on 2 cards and I get 2nd.&nbsp=3B I hope this tournamen=
t happens each year as I would play every year.&nbsp=3B From what I saw I h=
ad more beer than all other 16 players combined between 8-2.&nbsp=3B I thin=
k about bed but decide to play 2-3h more at the El Cortez.&nbsp=3B I win an=
other $300 but only have 2 more beers before bed time.&nbsp=3B This is firs=
t Friday and between El Cortez and 4Q I see 15 cop cars and lots of arrests=
.&nbsp=3B A cop takes my beer saying these 2 blocks you can't drink.&nbsp=
=3B I have had 15+ beers so no problem officer as I stumble home.&nbsp=3B <=
/div><div>&nbsp=3B</div><div>I am too worn out to even run on Saturday.&nbs=
p=3B I get to the tourney just in time and find David Heller is at my table=
.&nbsp=3B Only 2 players from Seattle area play right next to each other.&n=
bsp=3B David helped consult my on my legal standing when an Indian casino i=
n Seattle backroomed me by force and was going to keep my cash/chips.&nbsp=
=3B He also is a former Barge champion.&nbsp=3B The table was fun and I get=
 to remind ADB BigBoy the home brew he promised me for some&nbsp=3Bsoftware=
 discounts has not arrived in Seattle and Bruce promises to make good.&nbsp=
=3B I don't get too&nbsp=3Bmany hands and bleed off some chips while drinki=
ng a few beers.&nbsp=3B I get moved to a new table and shortly I pickup KK =
with about 2.3k left.&nbsp=3B I raise and Nick calls from the SB.&nbsp=3B B=

I had beat Nick on a total suckout on O8 tourney at Embargo to win eventual=
ly=2C so I get it.&nbsp=3B Nick is a great guy also though needs to working=
 on drinking form with that last name!&nbsp=3B I do win my gold for goldie =
bet and it is nice when he is at your table so you just collect on the spot=
.&nbsp=3B I also gave $50 to Peter for some ADB last longer bet.&nbsp=3B Gi=
ven that I am the main member of the "D" team I have no idea what I paid fo=
r or if I get any return.&nbsp=3B I have played at every Barge since 1994 (=
