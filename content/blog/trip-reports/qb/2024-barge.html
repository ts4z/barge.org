Bush was president the last time<br>she was at BARGE.<br><br>Razzdugi.  I catch a perfect river to make A-2-3-5-6.  I check.<br>Prock bets.  I say &quot;I raise one time.&quot;  Scoop a monster pot.<br><br>Samarel joins the game.  He had just hit AAAA on video poker to<br>get even for the trip.<br><br>Me: &quot;I&#39;ve been drinking.&quot;<br>Randal: &quot;I&#39;m proud of you for that.&quot;<br><br>I have no idea what time it is.  Randal and I decide to bet.<br>He says something like &quot;Price is Right style.  Closest without going over.&quot;<br>Being an idiot, I agree and say 9:07.  Randal says 9:08.  It&#39;s 9:15<br>so he wins my $1.  If I have to be swindled, good that it was Randal and<br>for just a buck.<br><br>Omaha-8.  235J.  Board is 2-3-6-5-7.  Checked down 4-ways after the flop.<br>I scoop.  Woo!<br><br>---<br><br>Razzd Grapes 4 folds.  No idea what that means.<br><br>---<br><br>Kuntz has an idea for a more crazy version of Razzdugi with four decks.<br>So a perfect hand would be a wheel with the A-2-3-4 all of different<br>suits and from different decks!  Oh my goodness.<br><br>---<br><br>Chris Kuntz is a big pinball guy, so I ask him about my favorite game<br>from the 1970s called &quot;Triple Action.&quot;  Of course he knows it well.<br><br>---<br><br>Bingo: &quot;I&#39;m running so bad that I&#39;m looking for video poker Razz.&quot;<br><br>Samarel has the bring in in E with a 3.  He gets a walk!<br><br>---<br><br>Around here Razz turns into Action Razz.<br>Good time for me to take a bathroom break.<br>I come back to find Kevin Un sitting in my seat.  He invented the game!<br><br>I decide to let Un play a couple of hands for me.<br>Of course a huge pot develops.  Un plays the hand fine until the river<br>as we have outs to scoop.  But we catch bad.  Oh well.<br><br>---<br><br>That moment at BARGE when you look across the table at Grizz and<br>get a little choked up realizing how blessed you are to have played<br>against him (and about 50 others) for over 25 years.<br><br>RCD = Random Comment Department.<br><br>RCD: &quot;Samarel&#39;s a pussy.&quot;<br><br><br>Friday, July 19th.<br>--------------------<br>Play Wordle right at midnight.  Something like 10 people on Facebook<br>depend on me to post my Wordle score so they can post theirs as comments<br>on my post.  Tough one.  Get it in six.<br><br>I&#39;m on Wordle Tilt as Kuntz gets it in four.  The word was REFER.<br><br>Go up to the room.  Finish the sandwich.  Fall asleep quickly for once.<br><br>Cell phone alarm goes off at 6:40 a.m.   Why!?!?<br><br><br>The BARGE Fun Run.<br><br>Three Participants:<br>Runners: Deadhead, Asya and me.  We all have water bottles with us.<br><br>It is Asya&#39;s &quot;easy&quot; day, so she wants to run about a 14 minutes pace.<br>That&#39;s about my top speed these days, so we should be good.<br><br>Asya sets the pace.  I run right with her.  Deadhead stays a few feet<br>behind as the sidewalk isn&#39;t very wide.  At a couple of points, it seems<br>like Deadhead is having a little trouble keeping up.  More on that later.<br><br>We talked about some things.  Asya mentioned some fun run that takes<br>place all over the country maybe once a month?<br><br>Anyway, we finished the 3-mile loop in 41:48.  13:56 per mile.  91 degrees.<br><br>Huh, Deadhead had a pack on the whole time.<br>He tells me to lift it.  I can barely get it off the ground with one hand.<br>It&#39;s a 40 pound pack.  Holy moley.<br><br>Deadhead gives me a Perle Haggard beer.  A pilsner.  An easy post-run beer.<br>We take a photo.  Talk to some cool-looking Air Force guys.<br><br>I posted to Poker Peeps that Rich Bremer won the Fun Run and $820.<br><br>---<br><br>I head up to the room for a much needed shower and breakfast.<br>Hmm...
