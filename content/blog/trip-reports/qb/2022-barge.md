The story of my twenty-seventh BARGE.  {{< br >}}
"Obi-wan Kenubi."

Monday, July 25th
--------

Attend the virtual BARGE Board of Directors meeting on Zoom.

Chuck Weinstock gets the first trip-report-worthy note{{< br >}}
when he says "That sets a high bar.  Did someone say *bar*?"{{< br >}}
Much laughter.  We missed you at BARGE, Chuck.

Thursday, July 28th.
--------

Kristina drops me off at SJC about 80 minutes before my flight.{{< br >}}
I giver her $20 as Uber would certainly be way more.{{< br >}}
TSA line quite long.  Amazing to me that only 15% of so of people{{< br >}}
are wearing masks.  It's still 80% at Costco.

Get to my gate 50 minutes early.  Devour a delicious sandwich{{< br >}}
that Sandi made for me earlier.

My flight gets in early and I'm in a little rush to get to the{{< br >}}
Westgate to check in and then register for the 4:00 tournament.{{< br >}}
John Lloyd's flight is tiny bit delayed so we missed meeting up.{{< br >}}
I apologized later and John told me not to worry about it.  Thanks.

First BARGER sighted in Kyle Minnis.

First hug goes to Mom Garrett.{{< br >}}
Quickly followed by Debbie, Kathy, Martin and Nancy.

Kevan Garrett gives be three old coins he's been saving for me.{{< br >}}
Two 1943 steel pennies and a 1964 silver dime.  Thanks!!!

Get my badge and sign up for the 4pm tournament.

Because I flew in Thursday afternoon, I missed the Death March{{< br >}}
(BARGE Golf outing) and also missed C-HORSE.  Will try to do both in 2023.

No line to check in?{{< br >}}
Leave my bags in the room and rush back down just in time for...

---

Pot-Limit Oklahoma tournament.  23 players, I believe.

I'm wearing a mask.  GamboMouse is sealed in a baggie.{{< br >}}
I'd say 30% of players are wearing masks.

We each get four cards, must play exactly two high and low.{{< br >}}
It can be the same two or a different two.  Or one of each.{{< br >}}
Board is like hold'em.  And you can bet up to what is in the pot.{{< br >}}
We have two rebuy lammers to use if/when we need more chips.

There are three flops/turns/rivers.{{< br >}}
The board(s) with the lowest river card is/are taken away.{{< br >}}
So you can have a wheel or quads on the turn and have it go away.

Table:{{< br >}}
Sharon K., Grizz, Dean, me, Nolan, Regis, DLow and Haroldson.

Ed. note:  I put "me" fourth as I am in seat four at the table, not because{{< br >}}
I don't know how to write.

---

Payoff massive sports betting debt to Nolan here.{{< br >}}
Good to have the money out of my wallet so that I can't lose it.

---

I can hear DLow and Haroldson talking about me, but have no idea what{{< br >}}
they are saying.

---

I have to use my reading glasses to see the suits.  First time!  Sad!{{< br >}}
I'm having trouble telling clubs and spades apart.

---

I take 3/4ths of a big pot against Nolan.{{< br >}}
It only takes the dealer about three minutes to divide the pot.

---

Regis and I both flop wheels and end up getting a quarter of the pot.{{< br >}}
We both checked and called the flop and turn and I think the river{{< br >}}
was checked around.

I walk over to Regis to say "We both played that horribly."{{< br >}}
Regis says "Go team Us!" and then we do a high-five!

---

Dean sends a $1 chip to the dealer using a race car.

Regis (to her opponent) when she wins a pot with a big full house:{{< br >}}
"You're going to need a bigger boat!"

Random Comment Department (RCD)  "Sexting with Sabyl."

Remember earlier when I said I was having trouble seeing suits?

I accidentally make a big bluff bet when I think I have a club flush.{{< br >}}
I get Grizz to fold a straight.   I turn up my cards only to see{{< br >}}
that three are spades.  Only one is a club.  {{< br >}}
This bluff saves Mark H. who wins the main pot with trips or something.

Regis calls GamboMouse "The bubble mouse."  Ha!

Dean shows us a cell photo of his wiener.

Doug Grismore wasn't feeling well on Wednesday and took a COVID test.{{< br >}}
He popped positive so is quarantining in his room for the rest of BARGE.

David Low and Dean get Doug into the action by betting on which{{< br >}}
flop will go away on the river.  DLow is dutifully taking photos on the{{< br >}}
flops and after the river of each hand to keep Doug informed.

---

Note says: Corey Neen Claudia.  Not sure what that means.  Probably hugs.{{< br >}}
Oh!  Neon!  Corey won a tournament earlier too.

Crunch (to someone): "Fuck you!"{{< br >}}
Much laughter.

Notes say: Crinl 3 chains.  What?

AA holds vs. DLow.

Player 1: "Wow!"{{< br >}}
Player 2: "That's what she said."

Emergency low for David Low.

---

Waitress gets me to switch from rum and Diet Coke to bourbon and Diet Coke."

My handwriting goes from 5th grade level to 2nd grade level.  At least the{{< br >}}
letters a big.

---

Down to 10.  Bremer and I are the last ADBs.  {{< br >}}
He has a 3-1 chip lead on me, but we do a $10 save for the ADB last longer.{{< br >}}
A good deal for me at the time, but worked out for Rich.

---

Final Table:{{< br >}}
Regis, Dean, DLow, me, Barry, Kyle, Bremer and Grizz.

---

Next note is a mystery...{{< br >}}
Dea 1 / Or XXXXX Vernon Kyle G zzz.

---

We come up with a save for 5th place.

Final 5 are Dean, DLow, me, Kyle ad Grizz.

---

Randal in up on the big screen of the sports book singing "When I'm 64."

Remember when "64" sounded really old?

---

Notes say "Becca hug.  Dean on tilt."  I don't think these were linked.

Me: "Time out under the floor."

I go out in 3rd place for $399 and a plaque.  Grizz beat me.{{< br >}}
I offered him a chip or a pair of dice.  He took the chip.

Hugs from Hack and Peter.{{< br >}}
Grizz defeats Dean.  Notes say "Mr. Bridesmaid."

---

I remember bits and pieces of a conversation with Gerdog on the{{< br >}}
way to my room.  Such a good guy.

---

Have two Pop-tarts, drink a glass or two of water and crash.



Friday, July 29th
--------

Cell phone alarm goes off at 6:40 a.m.   Why!?!?

{{< br >}}
The BARGE Fun Run.

Five Participants:{{< br >}}
Runners: Deadhead and me.

Lawful out with an injury.  Mickdog and Joe out due to COVID concerns.

Walkers: Keith Troell, Paul Stine and Len Greenberg.{{< br >}}
I don't recognize Len at first as he has lost weight and is wearing{{< br >}}
a baseball cap.

The weather is pretty good.  Overcast and in the low 70s.

Deadhead has the course plotted out and let me set the pace.{{< br >}}
About 12 minutes per mile for the 3.1-mile loop.{{< br >}}
Looking at notes, this is much faster than 2021.

Deadhead gives me a Fun Run bottle opener.  Thanks!

---

Take a great shower and do some shower laundry.

Back to bed for an hour.

---

BARGE BOD/Organizers breakfast at Sid's.

Table:{{< br >}}
Lawful, Russ, Rich B., Patti, Christian and me.

We talked about some stuff and had a free breakfast.  Thanks BARGE!

---

Online Calcutta bidding ends around here.  {{< br >}}
Not as fun as the live version, but certainly way better than nothing.{{< br >}}
I did all of the touts/comments on for the Calcutta.  {{< br >}}
If you need any explained, let me know.

Thanks to the people who set this up and special thanks to David Low{{< br >}}
for working with my comment file as plain text.

---

Tournament of Champions (TOC) tournament.{{< br >}}
Playing hold'em, 7-stud and Omaha-8.

{{< br >}}
Table:{{< br >}}
Peter, Claudia M., Dang? (Dan G.), Lawful, me, Joe, Dean and Crunch.

---

Today, I don't need my reading glasses!  {{< br >}}
Was it the 3-mile run or all the drinking Thursday night?{{< br >}}
More testing needed.

---

Jeanne makes a custom PG-13 mask for GamboMouse.  Pic posted on Facebook.{{< br >}}
Thanks Jeanne.

---

Dan talking to Dean: "I have a better king."{{< br >}}
Dean" "It's a jack."{{< br >}}
Dan: "Oh, I have a better jack."

I learn that Joe's nickname "Cap" is from his being a (retired) Captain{{< br >}}
for the NY Fire Dept. and yes, he was on the job on 9/11.

Peter: "Yeah, I have a gambling problem.  I'm not winning."

1:30 p.m.  We've been playing for almost two hours and I've won zero hands!

Make quad 3s to win a pot.  Yay!

---

Somewhere around here Patrick Kirwan gives me several Matchbox{{< br >}}
cars and trucks that he's had for 50 year.  He knows I collect{{< br >}}
Aurora, Hot Wheels and Matchbox cars.  Thanks again!!!

---

Crunch advises us on changing urinals when your luck is running bad.{{< br >}}
Doesn't everyone know this?

Jesse suffers a bad-beat in a 4-way pot with Crunch, Joe and Claudia.{{< br >}}
A river 7 puts a straight on the board to chop the pot.{{< br >}}
Jesse has 77 in hand.

Next, Crunch makes four aces in 7-stud.

RCD: "Don't write down the mushroom thing."

7-stud.{{< br >}}
Claudia brings it in showing a 5.{{< br >}}
I start with Q8-Q and complete.  Claudia calls.{{< br >}}
She calls 4th and catches a K on 5th and bets out as I pick up my 4th heart.{{< br >}}
I call and call again on 6th when I catch a 2nd 8.

She bets 3000 on the river.  I only have 4500 left.  {{< br >}}
I peer at my river card.  A lovely heart to make a flush!  I raise.{{< br >}}
She calls and rolls over 555KK for a well hidden full house.

I'm out.  I give Claudia a touchless thermometer and batteries{{< br >}}
as my bustout gift.

---

Claudia defeats Joe to with the TOC.  Way to go!

---

Rich S., Diana and I go for lunch/dinner at the cafe.{{< br >}}
I get a pastrami sandwich.  Diana gets the cheeseburger.{{< br >}}
Wow, her burger looks great.  We end up trading half of our orders.

The bill (before discounts) is $65 and I charge it to my room to save $10.{{< br >}}
I write in $13 for the tip.

Diana then throws in a $20 bill on top of the $13.  {{< br >}}
This is part of the 2022 Vic Mercer over-tipping tour.  {{< br >}}
Diana's way of honoring her dad who passed away recently.

*My* dad would be rolling over in his grave if he knew we tipped $33{{< br >}}
on a $65 tab.

---

Play a Quick Hits slot.  First spin.  Bet 30 cents.  Win!  I'm up $1.20.{{< br >}}
I quit and lock up the win.

---

5-Draw Quick Quads tournament.

This one is basically good old 5-card draw high.{{< br >}}
There's a weird rule about trips + two other cards making quads.

Table:{{< br >}}
Scottro, Gerdog, Oliver, me and Crunch.

After we draw our cards... Gerdog: "I got a rock."

RCD: "Caveman poker."

Scottro shows 88844.  Since 4 + 4 = 8, this qualifies as quad 8s!

Deitch: "I busted out before the first cards were dealt."

AA and bust Gerdog.

---

New Table:{{< br >}}
Oliver, Scottro, Becca, Dean, me and Capps.

Becca: "I'm always in the middle."

Jesse Capps is multi-tabling playing both the TOC and this tournament.

New Table again:{{< br >}}
Russ, Crunch, me, Howard, Bremer and DLow.  Capps busts Rich and David.

---

Marc Howard takes a lot of my chips with trips over two pair{{< br >}}
and two pair over two pair.

---

Final Table:{{< br >}}
Dean, Scottro, Howard, Russ, Bremer, me and Becca.

Vernon and Gambo take a selfie.

---

Rich goes out so I win a 2nd ADB last-longer bet.  Yay.

---

Scottro takes me out with two pair.  I roll him a pair of Dollar Tree{{< br >}}
dice as the bust out gift.

---

Dean, Scottro, Becca and Russ are the final four.{{< br >}}
A certain indecent proposal is made.

Russ (shaking his head): "NOOOOOO!"   Maybe you had to be there.

---

Dean wins it.  Is that allowed?



Saturday, July 30th.
--------

Get a decent night's sleep.

Pop Tarts and corn chips for breakfast.

Pack up and check out at 10:15 a.m.

I'll be playing poker until after midnight and have a 6:30 a.m. flight.{{< br >}}
I don't need a room, right?

---

The BARGE NL (No-Limit) event.  83 players.  Not bad considering.{{< br >}}
Only down 5 from 2021.

---

Show JZK GamboMouse in his baggie.  He's pleased that Gambo can't breathe.{{< br >}}
His son, Sam is the Virgin Queen.  All hail!

---

Around the Table:{{< br >}}
Lori, Sabyl, C. Jones, Aronson, Eric S., Ben, Kathy, me and Prock.

Several years ago, Prock and I played next to each other for about{{< br >}}
six hours.  But that time I had position.

Rodney drops off GamboMouse's first BARGE badge.

RCD Wordle: BLUFF.

Kathy: "Ken with a pen."

---

Carol A. arrives at table 11 with her suitcase!{{< br >}}
She came straight from the airport to the table.

---

99 and raise.  Sabyl cold calls in position.{{< br >}}
Flop is a friendly J-9-8 with two hearts.{{< br >}}
I bet about 6000.  Sabyl raises to 15,000.{{< br >}}
I make the call and plan to jam if a safe card falls on the turn.{{< br >}}
Turn Q.  Yuck.{{< br >}}
I check.  Sabyl jams.  I just frickin' hate this.{{< br >}}
She could have something like AhQh or just AJ.  Or JJ or TT or AhTh.{{< br >}}
I don't like it and fold.

I asked her later and she said she had JJ.  I believe her.{{< br >}}
If Sabyl *did* bluff me, I tip my cap.

Interestingly (or not) Sabyl and I agree that we've played{{< br >}}
very few hands against each other in over 20+ years of BARGE.{{< br >}}
It just seems like we aren't at the same table much.

---

I mention to Kathy that when I first played in the WSOP back around 2006,{{< br >}}
some random person asked for my autograph.  I thought perhaps the{{< br >}}
fan thought I was Ted Forrest.  Kathy didn't buy that.

Lori overhears this and says that I'll need to bust out the Grecian Formula{{< br >}}
if I want to look like Ted Forrest.  Youch!

I show Kathy my other look-a-like, Mark O'Meara.  She likes that one better.

---

BARGE group photo around here.  Rodney did a great job again.{{< br >}}
Although I did hear from Rich Strauss that Rodney gave him two{{< br >}}
correct photos *and* two photos of Edmund Hack!

---

Martin tells me that he's finally gotten his first BARGE cash.{{< br >}}
He signed up for the Blackjack tournament, got a refund because{{< br >}}
it didn't go and $20 in free slot play!  WTG Slick!

---

"Walk for Prock."  It rhymes, right?

---

Eric is fanning himself.  "Are you having a hot flash?"

---

The wild table behind us is having mimosas.{{< br >}}
Notes say "Table 11 busts Westgate out of champagne."  Well done!

---

At some point, Carol A. tells her table that she was a cheerleader{{< br >}}
in school.  Nolan says "Oh, that makes the fantasy even better!"{{< br >}}
Loud laughter.

Ed. note: The previous story was told to me second hand, so I hope{{< br >}}
I got most of it correct.

---

RCD: "People are busting like microwave popcorn."{{< br >}}
Kathy: "You want to be the burnt one at the end."

---

Folded to me in the SB.  I pretend to look at my cards and jam blind.{{< br >}}
Prock calls with T8s.  {{< br >}}
I tell him I haven't looked at my cards as I flip up KK!  I win.

Getting low on chips again.  The evil BB ante is coming so I again{{< br >}}
jam blind UTG.  It's a small raise and Kathy calls with K8.{{< br >}}
This time I flip up AJo.  Not bad!  Win that hand too.

Two more orbits and I'm low on chips again.  Blind jam UTG.{{< br >}}
Jesse calls with AQ.  I flip up 73o.  Oppsie!  Still 40% or so.{{< br >}}
Flop is 5-4-X giving me a lot of outs.{{< br >}}
Turn is a Q.  Uh oh.{{< br >}}
River X.  I'm out.

I left the cartoon book in my bag.  Will try to get it to Jesse next year.

---

Talk with John Grout around here about work and stuff.{{< br >}}
Something about little endian vs. big endian.

---

Banquet.{{< br >}}
Table:{{< br >}}
Lawful, Diana, Rich. S., Grizz and me.

Free round of drinks for the room courtesy of Diana.  Thank you!

I am starving, so I am pretty happy with the food.  {{< br >}}
Okay, the chicken could have been better.

Blair Rodman is our guest speaker.

His best line is what to do if you find an advantage game{{< br >}}
(a game where you have an advantage over the house.){{< br >}}
Blair: "Don't tell your fields!"{{< br >}}
Much laughter.

---

4-8 Dealer's Choice cash game.

Table:{{< br >}}
Christian, Bremer, Kluchman, Chris Q., Un, me, Ron and Diana.

Dealer starts taking a jackpot drop even though our games are{{< br >}}
not eligible for the jackpot.  Chris smartly grabs some Scotch tape{{< br >}}
and tapes over the jackpot drop slot.

I thought I went deaf at one point.  Turned out it was just that{{< br >}}
Un had gotten up for a minute.

---

I walk by the other table.  One player is visibly upset and Randal{{< br >}}
is talking to him and quickly cheering him up.  Randal also did this{{< br >}}
for me last year after I had lost a huge pot and was quite upset.

---

I gets stuck $80 very quickly and buy in again for a 2nd $100.{{< br >}}
My wallet is nearly empty.  Suddenly it dawns on me that I stuffed{{< br >}}
$700 away in one of my bags Thursday night after the PLOK cash.{{< br >}}
Woo hoo!

Finally win a pot.  It had been like an hour so I took a photo{{< br >}}
of the chips.

---

Somewhere around here Jesse wins the NL tournament.  Way to go!{{< br >}}
He is wearing a sash that said "BARGE Champion 2022" or something{{< br >}}
like that.

The final table was chock full of great friends of mine.{{< br >}}
I think I was most happy for Gerry who took 2nd and Nancy who took 5th.  {{< br >}}
Two of the nicest people at BARGE.  We've played a ton on Cliff's MB2 site{{< br >}}
(devctm.com) and I think it's helped our games a lot.

{{< br >}}
Sunday, July 31st.
--------

The DC game dies out, so I join the 4-8 HORSE game.

Tim, Dan, Randal, Crunch, Lawful, Grizz and me.

This game quickly turns into "The Randal Show."

Let me start by saying that Randal is a great guy.  Everyone likes him.{{< br >}}
He is very funny and may have had a drink or three.

I also need to thank Tim and David for repeating some of of the funny lines{{< br >}}
below so that I could capture them for this here trip report.

---

Randal to Dan: "You're evil in a sort of kind way."{{< br >}}
Too true, too true.

Randal: "I don't think..."{{< br >}}
Crunch "Obviously."

2-7 game.  I bet an 86542 after the 2nd draw.  Randal, Tim and I are all pat.{{< br >}}
We check it down.

I say "I have an 86."{{< br >}}
Randal says "I have an 86 too."  This is bad as I have a so-so 86.{{< br >}}
We table our hands.  Tim mucks.{{< br >}}
Randal has 876xy.  Me: "That's a very rough 86, man."

Randal calls me "Obi-wan Kenubi" a couple of times.  Love it.

"I don't know what it's like to be off my ass because I'm always on it."

Tim: "Try to learn this game when you're drunk so you remember it{{< br >}}
when you're sober."

Jessica the dealer chimes in with "Then you can read about it in{{< br >}}
the trip report."

"I would raise if I thought you had any idea what was going on."

The game breaks at 3:47 a.m.  Not bad for a bunch of mostly old guys.

Get my bags from the bell desk.{{< br >}}
Walk back by the poker room.  Grizz and Randal are still chatting.{{< br >}}
Uber to the airport.  Couple of problems in the TSA line.{{< br >}}
Little girl tries to take a stuffed giraffe through the scanner.{{< br >}}
Maybe they thought she was a drug mule.  A drug giraffe?{{< br >}}
I'm way early, so no worries.{{< br >}}
Actually fall asleep on the flight home.  This may be a first.

---

Kris picks me up at SJC.  I give her $20.  {{< br >}}
She says this early morning trip costs more.  "Surge pricing."  Ha!

---

Gambling...
