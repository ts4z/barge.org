  <p>
The story of my twenty-eighth BARGE.  <br>
&quot;Barnyard mayhem.&quot;
</p>

<p>
Sign up for BARGE as Ken.  I&#39;ve been using Kenny which has seemed to<br>
bring me luck.  Oh well, I&#39;m trying to get over this superstitious stuff.
</p>

<h2> Monday, July 17th. </h2>

Attend the virtual BARGE Board of Directors meeting on Zoom.<br>
Welcome Deron and Bruce to the BoD.  So long to Patti and JZK.<br>

<h2> Wednesday, July 19th. </h2>

<p>
Sandi drops me off at SJC about 80 minutes before my flight.<br>
I give her $20 as Uber would certainly be way more.</p>

<p>
I take an early aisle seat.  Later realize it is row 4.  I try to avoid 4s <br>
as they are bad luck, but I&#39;m trying to get over this stuff.</p>

<p>
Sandi made me two delicious sandwiches.  Destroy one pre-flight and<br>
the second in Vegas.</p>

<p>
Check-in.  Get the 4th floor.  I&#39;m trying to get over this superstitious <br>
crap so I just roll with it.  The room has not been remodeled.<br>
Very few electrical outlets, but it does have a bathtub which I like.</p>

<p>
Great view of the new sphere thingie from my room.</p>

<p>
Head downstairs.</p>

<p>
First BARGER sighted is Dr. Doofenshmirtz.</p>

<p>
First hug goes to Linda Llew.  Quickly followed by many others.</p>

<p>
Get my badge and get ready for C-HORSE.</p>

<p>
I&#39;ll be playing Crazy Pineapple.  Similar to hold&#39;em.<br>
Nancy has recruited me back to Team Moosecock.<br>
Months ago, I bought two Moose Beanie Babies at the flea market<br>
and they came in handy here.</p>

<p>
Around the table: Kyle, Kathy, D-Low, Chris Kl., Doug and me.</p>

<p>
Larry comments that he is on &quot;Team Going To Bed Early.&quot;</p>

<p>
D-Low has the low.  We are all chanting &quot;Muck his hand!  Muck his hand!&quot;</p>

<p>
Gambo says &quot;Hi&quot; to Sammy the Squirrel, a friend of Ron Lyon&#39;s.</p>

<p>
Sharon, after Chris turns off her ring: &quot;You&#39;re not sparkly anymore.&quot;</p>

<p>
Somewhere in here, Samarel orders a bunch of those crazy pineapple drinks.<br>
Awesome.  I buy one for him later.</p>

<p>
RCD (Random Comment Department) from one woman to another:<br>
&quot;As long as you don&#39;t kill him, you&#39;re going to heaven.&quot;</p>

<p>
Chris says &quot;Wake me up.&quot;<br>
Doug: &quot;Before you go go.&quot;</p>

<p>
Bex is carrying a bucket.  I ask her if she is trick-or-treating and then <br>
I toss a $1 chip into the bucket.<br>
Dean is rockin&#39; the mushroom hat.</p>

<p>
I toss a chip to the dealer.  Dealer: &quot;What&#39;s this for?&quot;<br>
Me: &quot;You laughed at my dumb joke.&quot;  Dealer: &quot;Appreciate it.&quot;</p>

<p>
RCD: &quot;I do what I want, bitch.  You can&#39;t stop me.&quot;</p>

<p>
RCD: Biggest lie in Wyoming: &quot;I was just helping the sheep over the fence.&quot;<br>

<hr>

<p>I really didn&#39;t write down any hands!?!?  Yay!</p>

<p>
We lost a little at C-HORSE.  Thanks to Nancy for organizing our team.</p>

<h2> Thursday, July 20th. </h2>
<p>
3-Hand Hold&#39;em tournament</p>

<p>
Each player gets six cards.  Arrange them into three 2-card hands.<br>
Discard on hand after the flop and one after the turn.</p>

<p>
I&#39;d estimate the 8% of the players are wearing masks.</p>

<p>
Table: Bob H., Mickdog, Chris K. and me.</p>

<p>
Heldar notes that Ron&#39;s squirrel is &quot;gathering the nuts.&quot;</p>

<p>
Quickly to a new table: Me, Deadhead, Kuntz, Dan G., Christin M., Gillian.</p>

<p>
Gillian: &quot;So Dan, how does this work?&quot;<br>
Deadhead: &quot;Dan puts out chips.  People take &#39;em.&quot;</p>

<p>
Keith comes by to take a selfie with Gambo and me.</p>

<p>
Dan calls me &quot;Ron.&quot;  Wow, that&#39;s freakin&#39; harsh, man.</p>

<p>
Another new table: Grapes, Chuck S., Christin, me, Byron and Grizz.</p>

<p>
Note: I put &quot;me&quot; in the middle as that is where my seat was.  K?</p>

<p>
Grapes (about Chuck S.) &quot;He&#39;s my mortal enemy.&quot;  Laughter.</p>

<p>
QQ and flop the other two queens.  Win a few chips.</p>

<p>
Christin: &quot;I didn&#39;t want to work 9-5 so I work 24-7.&quot;</p>

<p>
I get all-in on a flush draw with Ac4c.  I&#39;m hoping for the 6c on the river.<br>
The river is the 5c.  Pretty close.  I make my flush, but Grizz has queens <br>
full of 5s to knock me out.  He gets a chip magnet as my bust out gift.<br>

<hr>

<p>
Ron gives me a Coke Zero.  This seemed important at the time.</p>

<p>
Patti: &quot;I don&#39;t go on tilt, but I went on tilt as Costco.&quot;<br>
We all do, Patti.  We all do.</p>

<p>
Crunch explaining Korean poker: &quot;It&#39;s triple draw and at the end<br>
you cross the border.&quot;</p>

<p>
Ben (a dealer) shoots a wadded up structure sheet at the trash and sinks<br>
in from 14 feet out.<br>

<hr>

<p>
Dealer&#39;s Choice ring game:<br>
Regis, Steve W,, Lloyd, Claudia, Bowtie, me Kuntz, Chris Kl., Dan N.</p>

<p>
RCD: &quot;Big, small, I like &#39;em all.&quot;<br>

<hr>

<p>
Pot-Limit Omaha tournament.</p>

<p>
Four cards.  Must use two cards from your hand and three from the board<br>
to make your best poker hand.  </p>

<p>
We have two rebuy lammers.  A player can go broke and redeem a lammer <br>
for 5k in chips.</p>

<p>
Table: Empty seat, me, Bex, Dan, Tim Sh., Regis, Kuntz, Kelly, Larry.</p>

<p>
RCD: &quot;The more I drink, the better I get.&quot;</p>

<p>
Tootsie roll from Larry.  Candy.  Wow you have a filthy mind.</p>

<p>
I start drinking Jameson.  Grapes inspired.</p>

<p>
Bex has a jar of Fucks.  So she *does* give a fuck.</p>

<p>
Dean approaches likely to take the empty seat.</p>

<p>
Me: &quot;No! No! No! No! No!&quot; and then &quot;At least I&#39;m drawing live to win <br>
the tournament.  Laughter.<br>

<hr>

<p>
I can&#39;t read my notes here.<br>
Something about Dan G. and Kamikazes.<br>
Dan says &quot;No.&quot; to Randal.<br>
Waitress Beverly says &quot;Wa, Wa, Wa.&quot;</p>

<p>
Regis seeing some R-rated stuff between Bex&#39;s chicken and GamboMouse:<br>
&quot;Barnyard mayhem.&quot;</p>

<p>
Showalter tells me to write down that &quot;Tim was at my table.&quot;<br>

<hr>

<p>
6:47 p.m. notes say &quot;Feeling very loose.&quot;</p>

<p>
Walking back from a break, Nolan and I are laughing about paying off next <br>
year&#39;s sports bets in a photo in front of the urinals.</p>

<p>
Kelly calls someone a &quot;Fuck face.&quot;  Much laughter.<br>
Kelly is a BARGE rookie, but shows a lot of promise.</p>

<p>
RCD: &quot;Bex is a bad influence.&quot;  More laughter.</p>

<p>
Flop is 7-7-7.  Dealer gets three tokes.<br>
River is the 4th 7!  More tokes.</p>

<p>
About here I bust Dan G.  He gives me a very cool 3D printed <br>
Easter Island figure that doubles as a glasses holder.</p>

<p>
Un: &quot;Where&#39;s the mouse?&quot;  <br>
Someone else: &quot;He&#39;s choking the chicken.&quot;</p>

<p>
Dean wins a pot.  The table boos.</p>

<p>
Regis: &quot;Thousands of chips cried out.&quot;</p>

<p>
Sabyl: (about the chicken and Gambo) &quot;Not on the table for Christ&#39;s sake!&quot;<br>
Editor: OMG, I&#39;m laughing at this yet again.</p>

<p>
Larry: &quot;These are my friends.  You can imagine what my enemies do to me.&quot;</p>

<p>
&quot;Suck re-suck&quot;<br>
Christin and/or Christian: &quot;That sounds like my kind of party.&quot;<br>

<hr>

<p>
New table:<br>
Dr. Doof, me, Greg, Sabyl, Keith, Rick M., Kuntz, Cap and Chris Kl.</p>

<p>
KKxy and bust Rick.  I get a bottle of maple syrup.  Thanks.</p>

<p>
Knock out Cap.  He gives me a deck of Doyle Brunson cards.  Very cool.</p>

<p>
AAxy beats Sabyl KKxy.  <br>

<hr>

<p>
Final table:<br>
Hammer, Bremer, Russ, me, Kuntz, Corey, Kathy, Paul and Patrick.<br>
Editor&#39;s note: This is a brutal final table.</p>

<p>
The tournament is paying 7 spots. There are 9 of us.<br>
Likely there will be a save for 8th if I can hang on that long.</p>

<p>
I&#39;m getting low on chips and the evil BB ante looms.</p>

<p>
AJT4s in spades and raise all-in.  I&#39;m just hoping to survive another round<br>
or two.  Kathy calls.  I have a bad feeling.  Kathy is a very good player<br>
and she (and Caryl) hold over me almost all the time on Deadhead&#39;s <br>
CraftPoker site.  Kathy has a very strong hand.  KKxy double suited in<br>
hearts and diamonds.  I just need an ace or some spades.</p>

<p>
Sadly the flop is all hearts and I&#39;m drawing dead.<br>
I fling my bust out chip magnet across the table I think smacking <br>
Corey&#39;s chips.  Apologies to Corey and Kathy.</p>

<p>
I know you think *you* hate bubbling tournaments.  I&#39;m pretty damn sure<br>
I hate bubbling tournaments even more.  A couple of friends look<br>
like they want to console me as I walk away.  I kind of give them a<br>
little shake of my head to tell them &quot;not now guys.&quot;<br>
It is painful even now typing it all in.  Ugh.</p>

<h2> Friday, July 21st. </h2>

<p>Cell phone alarm goes off at 6:40 a.m.   Why!?!?</p>

<p>
The BARGE Fun Run.</p>

<p>
Five Participants:<br>
Runners: Deadhead Mickdog, Asya and me.  Bob Herlien is walking.<br>
We all have water bottles with us.</p>

<p>
First, I want to acknowledge the untimely passing of runner and good friend <br>
David Lawful.   Just a great guy.  A BARGEr that everyone liked.</p>

<p>
Last year, it was in the 70s.  Today, in is 91 degrees at 7:00 a.m.<br>
and probably got to the upper 90s by the time we finished.</p>

<p>
Mickdog and I take off jogging.<br>
A little under 14 minutes per mile pace.<br>
Deadhead walks with Bob early on.  Later he loops back to run with Asya.</p>

<p>
It&#39;s getting hotter and hotter as Mickdog and I are chatting and running.<br>
After two miles, the chatting turns into &quot;How are you doing?&quot;<br>
&quot;Are you holding up okay?&quot;</p>

<p>
As we approach the Westgate, Mickdog decides to walk the last few hundred<br>
yards.  I finish the run at the Westgate entrance.  Hey, did I win?<br>
41 minutes, 26 seconds.</p>

<p>
I walk back to look for Mickdog.  I can&#39;t find him!</p>

<p>
Minutes later, Asya and Deadhead come running up.<br>
Deadhead runs off to find Bob who may have taken a detour.</p>

<p>
Asya helps me backtrack maybe a 1/4 mile to make sure Mickdog isn&#39;t<br>
collapsed in a bush somewhere.  We chat a bit about diet and exercise.<br>
I listen carefully as Asya looks very fit these days.</p>

<p>
We meet up with Bob and Deadhead back at the entrance and take a photo.</p>

<p>
Mickdog and I figure out that he must have walked up a driveway<br>
behind a hedge as I walked down the main driveway.  Woo!</p>

<p>
Thanks to Deadhead for organizing the run.  Hope to see more people <br>
next year if it isn&#39;t 112 degrees.<br>

<hr>

<p>
Take a great shower and soak in the tub.<br>

<hr>

<p>
BARGE BOD/Organizers breakfast at Bagelmania.</p>

<p>
Russ drives Chuck and me over.<br>
Chuck is walking with a cane.  No, not due to his recent knee replacement.<br>
Some blisters on his foot/toes.  Ouch.</p>

<p>
Table:<br>
Doof, Goldie, Bruce, Russ, Rich B., Patti, Chuck, Deron and me.</p>

<p>
Some good discussions.<br>
I get the brisket sandwich.  Delicious.</p>

<p>
We talked about some stuff I can&#39;t divulge and had a free breakfast.  <br>
Thanks BARGE!<br>

<hr>

<p>
Back to the poker room.</p>

<p>
Online Calcutta bidding ends around here.  <br>
I did all of the touts/comments for the Calcutta.  <br>
If you need any explained, let me know.</p>

<p>
I bought Stillman/Samarel, Grout/Chic, Asya/Caryl, and Kuntz/Kania.<br>
Showalter&#39;s bidding AI failed to outbid me.</p>

<p>
Thanks to the people who set this up and special thanks to David Low<br>
who had to make many last-minute changes.<br>

<hr>

<p>
Tournament of Champions (TOC) tournament.<br>
Playing hold&#39;em, 7-stud and Omaha-8.</p>

<p>
Table:<br>
Me, Dan N., Regis, Oliver (the new one), Caryl, Ice, Byron and Brandon.</p>

<p>
The Floorman reminds me of an actor.  Josh Duhamel.  He also says Mr. Bean!<br>

<hr>

<p>
I decide to not drink for this one.<br>
Mostly had Diet Cokes and Sugar-free Red Bull.<br>

<hr>

<p>
7-stud.  A couple of players are having trouble seeing the cards on<br>
the other end of the table.  Jay, the dealer starts announcing the upcards!<br>
This is such a great idea.  Perhaps this should be a rule for our<br>
stud tournaments.<br>

<hr>

<p>
Regis: &quot;There will be a quiz later.&quot;</p>

<p>
I river a diamond flush to beat Caryl in a stud hand.<br>
Noteworthy because I rarely beat Caryl in any type of poker.</p>

<p>
Ice: &quot;Ken, your cards were blank.&quot;</p>

<p>
RCD: &quot;BARGE gets more BARGEy every day.&quot;  </p>

<p>
Me: &quot;I win one hand every half hour and everyone complains.&quot;</p>

<p>
Dan N.: &quot;My wife is too hot.&quot;</p>

<p>
Regis declares a &quot;Cocktail Emergency!&quot;<br>
And then makes the ambulance sound &quot;Woo woo woo woo.&quot;</p>

<p>
O8 BB A246.  Board is 3-5-6-6-J and I scoop!</p>

<p>
Dan: &quot;We broke the dealer.&quot;</p>

<p>
Dan knocks me out in hold&#39;em when his KT hits a K vs. my J4s.<br>
He got a deck of &quot;Omaha for Dummies&quot; cards.<br>

<hr>

<p>
Brandon and I played a couple of interesting hands.  <br>
After I busted I talked to him on a break about the hands.<br>
I&#39;m not sure we&#39;ve talked much before.  Good guy.<br>

<hr>

<p>
Lunch at the snack bar/grill with Crunch and Prock.  <br>
I got the Philly Cheese.  Can&#39;t recommend it.  20% discount helps.<br>
We talked about BAAP and even some politics.<br>

<hr>

<p>
Give the dime to JZK.  This was from a Facebook photo of one of my<br>
slot cars with the dime for perspective.  JZK commented that he&#39;d <br>
rather have the dime.  <br>

<hr>

<p>
Settle up dumb bets and backing refund with Bremer.<br>

<hr>

<p>
Lee: &quot;I have a good &#39;Fuck Grizz&#39; story.&quot;<br>

<hr>

<p>
Craps Crawl!</p>

<p>
I believe this is the first official Craps Crawl since 2019.<br>
The Westgate holds a table for us in the High Limit area.<br>
The dealers, box men and box woman are very friendly and get us.</p>

<p>
I&#39;m coaching John Lloyd as I am a craps expert having lost several<br>
thousands of dollars playing this game.  My estimate in $10,000 <br>
mostly in my 20s.</p>

<p>
First thing we discuss is that you don&#39;t say the word &quot;seven&quot; at<br>
the craps table.  You don&#39;t think it.  You don&#39;t say things like<br>
&quot;Come on 6 or 8.&quot; as the craps gods will average that to a 7.</p>

<p>
Around the table: Bremer, Showalter, Kuntz, Oliver, Steve W., <br>
Randal, Kluchman, John Lloyd and me.<br>
Bremer is the first shooter.  2, 12, 6, 7.<br>
Nice work Rich.  I&#39;m stuck $38 before we&#39;ve even ordered drinks.</p>

<p>
Waitress arrives.  While I&#39;m famous for drinking 7&amp;7s, this is <br>
tantamount to treason at a craps table.  For craps, I drink<br>
Harvey Wallbangers.  We are banging dice against a wall, so it works.<br>
Bremer and I try to order Wallbangers.  The waitress does not know<br>
this drink!  OMG.  How old am I?  I explain what it is and I think<br>
the bartender got it right.<br>

<hr>

<p>
Showalter is betting the Don&#39;ts a bit.  All of us are losing badly<br>
as none of us can hold the dice for more than 2 or 3 minutes.<br>
I think I rolled a come-out 11 to stem the tide.<br>
I&#39;m down about $150 and I&#39;ll quit if I lose $200.</p>

<p>
Oliver finally puts together a roll.  He makes four passes and rolls<br>
a lot of numbers to help out the place bettors.<br>
We are high-fiving Oliver.<br>

<hr>

<p>
I hit a couple of passes and bet a &quot;Horn High Yo&quot; in Kevan&#39;s honor.<br>
I roll the 11 for a $20 pass line win and $27 from the Horn bet.<br>

<hr>

<p>
John Lloyd gets the dice and goes on a nice run.  I lost track, but<br>
I think he made 6 passes with a come-out yo in there.<br>
Many high fives with John as everyone is digging out of deep holes.</p>

<p>
I count my chips.  I&#39;m up $8!  This feels like a $150 win at this point.<br>
I just stand around as John keeps rolling and winning money for everyone.<br>
I toss out a $1 yo and a couple of $1 hardways. </p>

<p>
Finally, I quit up $5.  Yes JZK, I locked up the win.</p>

<p>
I checked back maybe 40 minutes later and it looked like everyone <br>
was losing again.  Saddenz.</p>

<p>
Someone tell me if I&#39;m wrong, but I think I won the craps crawl.</p>

<p>
Anyway, it was a lot of fun and John and Oliver are my new heroes.<br>

<hr>

<p>
Dealer&#39;s Choice Ring Game</p>

<p>
Table: Dan N. (is he stalking me?), Patrick, Tony, Carol, Sandra, Sam,<br>
me and Lee.<br>

<hr>

<p>
John Lloyd suggest that we should have a Monte Blackjack tournament.<br>
I add the twist that it is a &quot;Must Drink&quot; tournament with the drink <br>
choices being Manhattans, Newcastle, Patron shots or Double Stoli-crans.<br>
Organizers, please get on this stat!<br>

<hr>

<p>
Ron has a breast implant on the table.  A &quot;bust&quot; out gift.  Groan.</p>

<p>
Caryl: &quot;See ya Tamara.&quot;  It was hilarious, trust me.</p>

<p>
Around here I meet Salim.  A super nice guy that I played with on <br>
CraftPoker.com but had never met live.  Good to put a person with<br>
the online name.  <br>

<hr>

<p>
Tony (to Ron): &quot;We are fighting over who gets to tell you to fuck yourself.&quot;</p>

<p>
RCD: &quot;They&#39;re real and they&#39;re spectacular.&quot;</p>

<p>
Secondhand RCD: &quot;I&#39;d rather show you my tits than my cards.&quot;</p>

<p>
RCD: &quot;A thruple maybe?&quot;</p>

<p>
RCD: &quot;Mistress of the placards.&quot; and &quot;That&#39;s what she said.&quot;</p>

<p>
We start playing Tic-Tac-Toemaha.  You can use two of your cards<br>
with any column, row or either diagonal.  The board ends up<br>
like a tic-tac-toe board.</p>

<p>
Patrick: &quot;I&#39;ll take Charlie Weaver for the block.&quot;  Much laughter.</p>

<p>
Lee and Ron are drinking Kentucky Mules.  Not bad.</p>

<p>
QB (after 22 drinks): &quot;I have not yet begun to drink.&quot;<br>
Trust me, it was hilarious.</p>

<p>
Ron: &quot;Let&#39;s have a round of applause for Rick Blemer.&quot;</p>

<p>
QB: &quot;Just badugi?&quot;<br>
Grizz: &quot;As opposed to unjust badugi.&quot;</p>

<p>
Someone orders a Diet Cocaine?<br>
My notes fail me.  It was a Diet Coke and something else.<br>

<hr>

<p>
Badugi round.</p>

<p>
Sam and another player are pat on the 2nd draw.  Sam calls.<br>
Both are pat on the third draw.  Player bets, Sam folds an 8!!!!!!<br>
Other player shows a 7.  Holy crap.  I told Sam he really should give the<br>
other player $8 as that is an impossible fold.</p>

<p>
Sam loses with another 8.  Yeesh.  Unlucky.</p>

<p>
Sam check-raises Lee after the 2nd draw.  Lee calls.<br>
Pat-pat.  Sam bets, Lee calls.<br>
Sam shows a 7.  Nice!  Lee Crocker rolls over a 6 to win the pot.<br>
I see monsters under the bed all the time, but I would have thrown<br>
in one more raise with a 6 badugi.</p>

<p>
I told Sam that that was the worst luck I had ever seen someone have in <br>
one round of badugi.  <br>

<hr>

<p>
I actually booked a $75 win in this game.  Yay!<br>

<hr>

<p>
Grab a Reuben sandwich on the way to the room.  Yum.</p>

<h2> Saturday, July 22nd. </h2>
Meet Rich Strauss for breakfast at Sid&#39;s.<br>
Whatever I had was really good.   <br>
One good thing about dining with Rich is that you are bound to get some<br>
extra food that he can&#39;t eat.  Extra toast this time.</p>

<p>
We discussed baseball and Cal sports.  We figured out that we were<br>
both at a 1969 Cal basketball game where Cal took undefeated UCLA<br>
(with Lew Alcindor a.k.a. Kareem) to overtime.<br>

<hr>

<p>
Around here Randal sings a few bars of a Beatles&#39;s song for me.<br>
What a voice!<br>

<hr>

<p>
The BARGE NL (No-Limit) event.  98 players.  Up 15 from 2022.  Take that R.<br>

<hr>

<p>
Around the Table:<br>
Kevan, Sassy, me, JZK, Lee, Scottro, Sam, Prock and Hack.</p>

<p>
I&#39;m wearing a custom Hawaiian shirt with photos of Taylor the Dog on it.</p>

<p>
I note that except for Sassy, we all have a &quot;K&quot; in our names.&quot;</p>

<p>
Sassy is very hoarse.  Thank goodness for my new hearing aids.</p>

<p>
Sidebar: Sassy (Stephanie) has been coming to BARGE for many years.<br>
I don&#39;t think I had said more than 20 words to her before this trip.<br>
It was nice to get to know her after all this time.</p>

<p>
She had very pretty chrome green nails.  See my Facebook pics.<br>

<hr>

<p>
Kevan: &quot;Chic wouldn&#39;t even call this.&quot; as he sadly mucks his hand.</p>

<p>
JZK: &quot;Only 10,800 more to you.&quot;<br>
Me: &quot;I&#39;m still in?&quot;   Much laughter.</p>

<p>
Discussions include $2 bills, motorcycles, and car engines on fire/melting.<br>

<hr>

<p>
Around here Russ gives me two chilled cans of Coke Zero.<br>
This saves the day when the waitress goes into witness protection.<br>

<hr>

<p>
Actual interesting hand (1 of 2):</p>

<p>
Dealer exposes a Q dealing to Sassy. </p>

<p>
I have QQ in early position and make a standard raise to 1500.<br>
Scottro makes it 5300.  Wow.</p>

<p>
If it were a lot later, I&#39;d shove here, but with one queen dead,<br>
I decided to fold.  I show the QQ.  Scottro shows KK!  <br>
Dodged a bullet there.<br>

<hr>

<p>
Kevan posts a blind from the cut-off?<br>
QB: &quot;Australian Rules hold&#39;em?&quot;<br>
Sassy: &quot;Like the toilets.&quot; making a circular motion.<br>
Kevan: &quot;That&#39;s where all my chips go.&quot;<br>

<p>
BARGE group photo around here.  Rodney did a great job as usual.<br>

<hr>

<p>
Actual interesting hand (2 of 2):</p>

<p>
AJ and make it 4600.  Sam calls.<br>
Flop J-T-9.  I bet 6500.  Sam calls again.  Hmm.<br>
Turn is a 5.  I have 22,000 left.  I&#39;m never folding, so I just jam.<br>
Sam goes into the tank.  Well, at least it wasn&#39;t a snap call.<br>
I have him on QJs.  Top pair, open ender.<br>
He says &quot;It&#39;s hard to make a pair.&quot;  So maybe he thinks I have AK or AQ.  </p>

<p>
When someone goes into the tank, I pick some object on the table<br>
and stare at it.  This is going on for a *long* time.<br>
I say &quot;It&#39;s getting hard to hold my stare this long.&quot;<br>
Sam finally folds after 2 minutes.  QTs.  Good fold.<br>

<hr>

<p>
Kevan: &quot;That&#39;s no lady.  That&#39;s Gillian.&quot;  Ha!</p>

<p>
Patti: &quot;KevON, why are you calling me.&quot;<br>
Kevan: &quot;I&#39;ve never called you KevON.&quot;  Laughter.<br>

<hr>

<p>
Flop T-6-2.  Sassy and Scottro jam it up.<br>
She has 66.  He has TT.  Youch.  <br>

<hr>

<p>
I ask for blues (chips).  Patti starts singing a blues song.  Nice.</p>

<p>
Table update:<br>
Kevan, Grout, me, Patti, Steve Jaleus?, Kramer, Sam, Andy Bloch, Hack.<br>

<hr>

<p>
Larry joins the table.</p>

<p>
I jam UTG with Q6o.  Larry calls with A8s.  Not the worst spot for me.<br>
Flop J-3-3.  Lights are dimming.<br>
Turn A.  Larry gets a signed copy of my cartoon trivia book.<br>

<hr>

<p>
I usually feel awful when I bust out of the main event at BARGE,  but<br>
I actually feel pretty good this time.<br>

<hr>

<p>
Not 30 seconds later applause erupts as Goldie busts out.<br>
Dang.  Lost a $10 last-longer to Goldie too.  Sigh.<br>

<hr>

<p>
Patti wrote something in my notes.  I can&#39;t mention it here, but<br>
I was laughing hard for a good 10 or 15 seconds.<br>

<hr>

<p>
I&#39;m a railbird now.</p>

<p>
Ross needs some toke chips.  I know I have a bunch in my bag.<br>
I&#39;m digging for chips.  Grapes sees this and asks &quot;Drugs?&quot;</p>

<p>
I get about 10 chips for Ross and find two orange DayQuil caplets.<br>
Grapes pops them to help with a minor headache.<br>

<hr>

<p>
Dinner at Fresco (the Italian place.)</p>

<p>
Table: Caryl, David. A., Russ, Deron, Jodi and me.</p>

<p>
I had the Chicken Marsala and it was very good.</p>

<p>
We talked about first jobs and using punch cards at college.<br>
Anyway, thanks for inviting me along.<br>
 
<hr>

<p>
Back to the poker room.<br>
Slick has a concealed carry permit for his suspenders.<br>

<hr>

<p>
John Grout is my best horse, but he just misses the money.<br>

<hr>

<p>
Get called for the Chowaha game.<br>
Table: Asya, Hack, Ben, Claudia, Regis, Aronsons and me.<br>
I fold two hands and then get called for HORSE.</p>

<p>
QB: &quot;I didn&#39;t win a single hand at this table.&quot;<br>

<hr>

<p>
HORSE game.<br>
Table: Betty, Doof, Laurie, Dean, Scottro, Bex, Stewe W. and me.</p>

<p>
I get called for the Dealer&#39;s Choice game.  Rack up and leave.<br>

<hr>

<p>
Dealer&#39;s Choice.<br>
Table: Me, Christin M., Lee, Randal, Crunch, Sandra, Samarel and Eileen.</p>

<p>
Gambo meets Poldi who is Chritin&#39;s mascot.</p>

<p>
D-Low slow-rolls Doug.  Not on purpose, but it was really funny.</p>

<p>
RCD: &quot;We are playing traditional Inception.&quot;<br>

<hr>

<p>
Applause from the other room.  Rich Bremer wins the main event. <br>
Nolan Dalla to place.  David Kluchman to show.  My chips made it to 4th <br>
with Larry.  5-10.  Sheila, Doug, Len, Bruce, Eric S. and Mickdog.</p>

<p>
Rich walks into the poker room to a standing ovation and people<br>
chanting &quot;Rich!  Rich!  Rich!&quot;<br>

<hr>

<p>
Sabyl takes Christin&#39;s spot next to me.  Gambo waves to her.<br>
Sabyl starts talking about taking Gambo home to Kai and Steve.<br>
And then starts bouncing Gambo on the rail and doing &quot;rat speak.&quot;<br>
Saying &quot;Ruh, ruh, ruh, Steve.  Ruh, ruh, ruh, Steve.&quot;<br>
There&#39;s no way I can do this justice in writing.<br>
Gambo then gave Sabyl a kiss on the cheek.  Flirty mouse!<br>

<hr>

<p>
Someone to Scott: &quot;Don&#39;t listen to them.&quot;<br>
Scott: &quot;Trust me, I&#39;m not.&quot;<br>

<hr>

<p>
We play Anaconda!  7-pass 3, pass 2, pass 1.  High-Low Roll your own.<br>
The passing is to the dealer to avoid collusion.</p>

<p>
Lee wins a monster with 5555 vs. two big full houses.<br>
It looked like he had lock low after 4 cards.  Nice pot.</p>

<p>
Notes say &quot;80 seconds.&quot;  Oh!  I know what that means.</p>

<p>
Katie Baxter appears.  She flew in to get a little taste of BARGE.</p>

<p>

<h2> Sunday, July 23rd. </h2>
About 1:00 a.m.  Our game and the Pot-Limit Binglaha are still going strong.<br>
It has actually gotten louder in the poker room after midnight.<br>

<hr>

<p>
Around here Sam asks if I have notes on that horrible run at badugi.<br>
See above kiddo.<br>

<hr>

<p>
Someone busts Sam in the Binglaha game.  The other players applaud<br>
as we do in the tournaments.  This was quite funny.</p>

<p>
As I mentioned in a text, Sam has great degen bloodlines.<br>
He fits in with us very well at the advanced age of 22.</p>

<p>
RCD: To a whining player &quot;Aww, you only lost $100 at BARGE.&quot;</p>

<p>
Randal: &quot;I&#39;m here to drink and have fun.&quot;<br>
Ed Baker, we need T-shirts.  L for Randal, XL for me.</p>

<p>
RCD: &quot;Once you&#39;ve had meth, Adderall just doesn&#39;t cut it anymore.&quot;</p>

<p>
We play River of Blood.  Extra river cards as long as the last card is red.<br>
Heart and diamond flush draws are always live.</p>

<p>
Dan G.: &quot;Here&#39;s the thing about poker... nobody gives a shit.&quot;</p>

<p>
There was something about lap dances and Hammer.  Oh, the humanity.</p>

<p>
Sabyl squeals as she scoops a big pot in Binglaha.</p>

<p>
Hammer votes me off the island.  Sad.</p>

<p>
Our game breaks at about 3:30 a.m.  The Binglaha went until 8:00 a.m. or so.<br>
Good job people!</p>

<p>
Oh, our last dealer was a blonde lady with a great smile.<br>
Reminded me a lot of Tina.  Again, see my pics on Facebook.<br>

<hr>

<p>
Another Reuben from Fortuna on the way to the room.<br>

<hr>

<p>
Come down to the poker room around 11:30.  Watch Ron torture the locals<br>
in an NL game.</p>

<p>
Bruce asks if I want to go to Pizza Rock.  For sure.<br>

<hr>

<p>
Pizza Rock with Bruce, Asya, Ben, Kenny and Jodi.<br>
We ordered way too much food.  The Motorhead pizza was the best.</p>

<p>
Exchange between Asya and Bruce: &quot;Gimme.  No gimme.  No gimme.&quot;</p>

<p>
We play CCR for the bill.  It comes down to Asya and Ben so I think Asya<br>
paid.  Thanks!<br>

<hr>

<p>
We Uber to the Goldman&#39;s for the after party.  Uber, brought to you by<br>
Kenny and Ken.</p>

<p>
Take photos of the four sweet dogs.  OMG, the dogs just loved Ben and Asya.</p>

<p>
Talked with Deadhead about rescue rats.  </p>

<p>
I talked with Ice, Tim Stine, Rodney, Nolan and a bunch of other people.</p>

<p>
My alarm goes off.  Without thinking much, I order an Uber to the airport.</p>

<p>
Ack!  I have 3 minutes to say goodbye.  I run around waving and <br>
saying &quot;Happy BARGE!&quot; to about 30 people.<br>

<hr>

<p>
Lady driver was a crack up on the way to the airport.<br>

<hr>

<p>
Window seat for the flight home.<br>
Guy next to me ordered a cocktail.  They finally get us our drinks<br>
and then not two minutes later they start coming through to pick <br>
them up.  We drank up quickly.<br>

<hr>

<p>
Kristina picks me up at SJC and we pick up $5 boxes at Taco Bell<br>
on the way home.</p>

<p>
