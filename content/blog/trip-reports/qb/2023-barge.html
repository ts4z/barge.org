to Sammy the Squirrel, a friend of Ron Lyon&#39;s.<br><br>Sharon, after Chris turns off her ring: &quot;You&#39;re not sparkly anymore.&quot;<br><br>Somewhere in here, Samarel orders a bunch of those crazy pineapple drinks.<br>Awesome.  I buy one for him later.<br><br>RCD (Random Comment Department) from one woman to another:<br>&quot;As long as you don&#39;t kill him, you&#39;re going to heaven.&quot;<br><br>Chris says &quot;Wake me up.&quot;<br>Doug: &quot;Before you go go.&quot;<br><br>Bex is carrying a bucket.  I ask her if she is trick-or-treating and then <br>I toss a $1 chip into the bucket.<br>Dean is rockin&#39; the mushroom hat.<br><br>I toss a chip to the dealer.  Dealer: &quot;What&#39;s this for?&quot;<br>Me: &quot;You laughed at my dumb joke.&quot;  Dealer: &quot;Appreciate it.&quot;<br><br>RCD: &quot;I do what I want, bitch.  You can&#39;t stop me.&quot;<br><br>RCD: Biggest lie in Wyoming: &quot;I was just helping the sheep over the fence.&quot;<br><br>---<br><br>I really didn&#39;t write down any hands!?!?  Yay!<br><br>We lost a little at C-HORSE.  Thanks to Nancy for organizing our team.<br><br><br>Thursday, July 20th.<br>-----------------------<br><br>3-Hand Hold&#39;em tournament<br><br>Each player gets six cards.  Arrange them into three 2-card hands.<br>Discard on hand after the flop and one after the turn.<br><br>I&#39;d estimate the 8% of the players are wearing masks.<br><br>Table: Bob H., Mickdog, Chris K. and me.<br><br>Heldar notes that Ron&#39;s squirrel is &quot;gathering the nuts.&quot;<br><br>Quickly to a new table: Me, Deadhead, Kuntz, Dan G., Christin M., Gillian.<br><br>Gillian: &quot;So Dan, how does this work?&quot;<br>Deadhead: &quot;Dan puts out chips.  People take &#39;em.&quot;<br><br>Keith comes by to take a selfie with Gambo and me.<br><br>Dan calls me &quot;Ron.&quot;  Wow, that&#39;s freakin&#39; harsh, man.<br><br>Another new table: Grapes, Chuck S., Christin, me, Byron and Grizz.<br><br>Note: I put &quot;me&quot; in the middle as that is where my seat was.  K?<br><br>Grapes (about Chuck S.) &quot;He&#39;s my mortal enemy.&quot;  Laughter.<br><br>QQ and flop the other two queens.  Win a few chips.<br><br>Christin: &quot;I didn&#39;t want to work 9-5 so I work 24-7.&quot;<br><br>I get all-in on a flush draw with Ac4c.  I&#39;m hoping for the 6c on the river.<br>The river is the 5c.  Pretty close.  I make my flush, but Grizz has queens <br>full of 5s to knock me out.  He gets a chip magnet as my bust out gift.<br><br>---<br><br>Ron gives me a Coke Zero.  This seemed important at the time.<br><br>Patti: &quot;I don&#39;t go on tilt, but I went on tilt as Costco.&quot;<br>We all do, Patti.  We all do.<br><br>Crunch explaining Korean poker: &quot;It&#39;s triple draw and at the end<br>you cross the border.&quot;<br><br>Ben (a dealer) shoots a wadded up structure sheet at the trash and sinks<br>in from 14 feet out.<br><br>---<br><br>Dealer&#39;s Choice ring game:<br>Regis, Steve W,, Lloyd, Claudia, Bowtie, me Kuntz, Chris Kl., Dan N.<br><br>RCD: &quot;Big, small, I like &#39;em all.&quot;<br><br>---<br><br>Pot-Limit Omaha tournament.<br><br>Four cards.  Must use two cards from your hand and three from the board<br>to make your best poker hand.  <br><br>We have two rebuy lammers.  A player can go broke and redeem a lammer <br>for 5k in chips.<br><br>Table: Empty seat, me, Bex, Dan, Tim Sh., Regis, Kuntz, Kelly, Larry.<br><br>RCD: &quot;The more I drink, the better I get.&quot;<br><br>Tootsie roll from Larry.  Candy.  Wow you have a filthy mind.<br><br>I start drinking Jameson.  Grapes inspired.<br><br>Bex has a jar of Fucks.  So she *does* give a fuck.<br><br>Dean approaches likely to take the empty seat.<br><br>Me: &quot;No! No! No! No! No!&quot; and then &quot;At least I&#39;m drawing live to win <br>the tournament.  Laughter.<br><br>---<br><br>I can&#39;t read my notes here.<br>Something about Dan G. and Kamikazes.<br>Dan says &quot;No.&quot; to Randal.<br>Waitress Beverly says &quot;Wa, Wa, Wa.&quot;<br><br>Regis seeing some R-rated stuff between Bex&#39;s chicken and GamboMouse:<br>&quot;Barnyard mayhem.&quot;<br><br>Showalter tells me to write down that &quot;Tim was at my table.&quot;<br><br>---<br><br>6:47 p.m. notes say &quot;Feeling very loose.&quot;<br><br>Walking back from a break, Nolan and I are laughing about paying off next <br>year&#39;s sports bets in a photo in front of the urinals.<br><br>Kelly calls someone a &quot;Fuck face.&quot;  Much laughter.<br>Kelly is a BARGE rookie, but shows a lot of promise.<br><br>RCD: &quot;Bex is a bad influence.&quot;  More laughter.<br><br>Flop is 7-7-7.  Dealer gets three tokes.<br>River is the 4th 7!  More tokes.<br><br>About here I bust Dan G.  He gives me a very cool 3D printed <br>Easter Island figure that doubles as a glasses holder.<br><br>Un: &quot;Where&#39;s the mouse?&quot;  <br>Someone else: &quot;He&#39;s choking the chicken.&quot;<br><br>Dean wins a pot.  The table boos.<br><br>Regis: &quot;Thousands of chips cried out.&quot;<br><br>Sabyl: (about the chicken and Gambo) &quot;Not on the table for Christ&#39;s sake!&quot;<br>Editor: OMG, I&#39;m laughing at this yet again.<br><br>Larry: &quot;These are my friends.  You can imagine what my enemies do to me.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Suck re-suck&quot;<br>Christin and/or Christian: &quot;That sounds like my kind of party.&quot;<br><br>---<br><br>New table:<br>Dr. Doof, me, Greg, Sabyl, Keith, Rick M., Kuntz, Cap and Chris Kl.<br><br>KKxy and bust Rick.  I get a bottle of maple syrup.  Thanks.<br><br>Knock out Cap.  He gives me a deck of Doyle Brunson cards.  Very cool.<br><br>AAxy beats Sabyl KKxy.  <br><br>---<br><br>Final table:<br>Hammer, Bremer, Russ, me, Kuntz, Corey, Kathy, Paul and Patrick.<br>Editor&#39;s note: This is a brutal final table.<br><br>The tournament is paying 7 spots. There are 9 of us.<br>Likely there will be a save for 8th if I can hang on that long.<br><br>I&#39;m getting low on chips and the evil BB ante looms.<br><br>AJT4s in spades and raise all-in.  I&#39;m just hoping to survive another round<br>or two.  Kathy calls.  I have a bad feeling.  Kathy is a very good player<br>and she (and Caryl) hold over me almost all the time on Deadhead&#39;s <br>CraftPoker site.  Kathy has a very strong hand.  KKxy double suited in<br>hearts and diamonds.  I just need an ace or some spades.<br><br>Sadly the flop is all hearts and I&#39;m drawing dead.<br>I fling my bust out chip magnet across the table I think smacking <br>Corey&#39;s chips.  Apologies to Corey and Kathy.<br><br>I know you think *you* hate bubbling tournaments.  I&#39;m pretty damn sure<br>I hate bubbling tournaments even more.  A couple of friends look<br>like they want to console me as I walk away.  I kind of give them a<br>little shake of my head to tell them &quot;not now guys.&quot;<br>It is painful even now typing it all in.  Ugh.<br><br><br><br>Friday, July 21st.<br>--------------------<br>Cell phone alarm goes off at 6:40 a.m.   Why!?!?<br><br><br>The BARGE Fun Run.<br><br>Five Participants:<br>Runners: Deadhead Mickdog, Asya and me.  Bob Herlien is walking.<br>We all have water bottles with us.<br><br>First, I want to acknowledge the untimely passing of runner and good friend <br>David Lawful.   Just a great guy.  A BARGEr that everyone liked.<br><br>Last year, it was in the 70s.  Today, in is 91 degrees at 7:00 a.m.<br>and probably got to the upper 90s by the time we finished.<br><br><br>Mickdog and I take off jogging.<br>A little under 14 minutes per mile pace.<br>Deadhead walks with Bob early on.  Later he loops back to run with Asya.<br><br>It&#39;s getting hotter and hotter as Mickdog and I are chatting and running.<br>After two miles, the chatting turns into &quot;How are you doing?&quot;<br>&quot;Are you holding up okay?&quot;<br><br>As we approach the Westgate, Mickdog decides to walk the last few hundred<br>yards.  I finish the run at the Westgate entrance.  Hey, did I win?<br>41 minutes, 26 seconds.<br><br>I walk back to look for Mickdog.  I can&#39;t find him!<br><br>Minutes later, Asya and Deadhead come running up.<br>Deadhead runs off to find Bob who may have taken a detour.<br><br>Asya helps me backtrack maybe a 1/4 mile to make sure Mickdog isn&#39;t<br>collapsed in a bush somewhere.  We chat a bit about diet and exercise.<br>I listen carefully as Asya looks very fit these days.<br><br>We meet up with Bob and Deadhead back at the entrance and take a photo.<br><br>Mickdog and I figure out that he must have walked up a driveway<br>behind a hedge as I walked down the main driveway.  Woo!<br><br>Thanks to Deadhead for organizing the run.  Hope to see more people <br>next year if it isn&#39;t 112 degrees.<br><br>---<br><br>Take a great shower and soak in the tub.<br><br>---<br><br>BARGE BOD/Organizers breakfast at Bagelmania.<br><br>Russ drives Chuck and me over.<br>Chuck is walking with a cane.  No, not due to his recent knee replacement.<br>Some blisters on his foot/toes.  Ouch.<br><br>Table:<br>Doof, Goldie, Bruce, Russ, Rich B., Patti, Chuck, Deron and me.<br><br>Some good discussions.<br>I get the brisket sandwich.  Delicious.<br><br>We talked about some stuff I can&#39;t divulge and had a free breakfast.  <br>Thanks BARGE!<br><br>---<br><br>Back to the poker room.<br><br>Online Calcutta bidding ends around here.  <br>I did all of the touts/comments for the Calcutta.  <br>If you need any explained, let me know.<br><br>I bought Stillman/Samarel, Grout/Chic, Asya/Caryl, and Kuntz/Kania.<br>Showalter&#39;s bidding AI failed to outbid me.<br><br>Thanks to the people who set this up and special thanks to David Low<br>who had to make many last-minute changes.<br><br>---<br><br>Tournament of Champions (TOC) tournament.<br>Playing hold&#39;em, 7-stud and Omaha-8.<br><br><br>Table:<br>Me, Dan N., Regis, Oliver (the new one), Caryl, Ice, Byron and Brandon.<br><br>The Floorman reminds me of an actor.  Josh Duhamel.  He also says Mr. Bean!<br><br>---<br><br>I decide to not drink for this one.<br>Mostly had Diet Cokes and Sugar-free Red Bull.<br><br>---<br><br>7-stud.  A couple of players are having trouble seeing the cards on<br>the other end of the table.  Jay, the dealer starts announcing the upcards!<br>This is such a great idea.  Perhaps this should be a rule for our<br>stud tournaments.<br><br>---<br><br>Regis: &quot;There will be a quiz later.&quot;<br><br>I river a diamond flush to beat Caryl in a stud hand.<br>Noteworthy because I rarely beat Caryl in any type of poker.<br><br>Ice: &quot;Ken, your cards were blank.&quot;<br><br>RCD: &quot;BARGE gets more BARGEy every day.&quot;  <br><br>Me: &quot;I win one hand every half hour and everyone complains.&quot;<br><br>Dan N.: &quot;My wife is too hot.&quot;<br><br>Regis declares a &quot;Cocktail Emergency!&quot;<br>And then makes the ambulance sound &quot;Woo woo woo woo.&quot;<br><br>O8 BB A246.  Board is 3-5-6-6-J and I scoop!<br><br>Dan: &quot;We broke the dealer.&quot;<br><br>Dan knocks me out in hold&#39;em when his KT hits a K vs. my J4s.<br>He got a deck of &quot;Omaha for Dummies&quot; cards.<br><br>---<br><br>Brandon and I played a couple of interesting hands.  <br>After I busted I talked to him on a break about the hands.<br>I&#39;m not sure we&#39;ve talked much before.  Good guy.<br><br>---<br><br>Lunch at the snack bar/grill with Crunch and Prock.  <br>I got the Philly Cheese.  Can&#39;t recommend it.  20% discount helps.<br>We talked about BAAP and even some politics.<br><br>---<br><br>Give the dime to JZK.  This was from a Facebook photo of one of my<br>slot cars with the dime for perspective.  JZK commented that he&#39;d <br>rather have the dime.  <br><br>---<br><br>Settle up dumb bets and backing refund with Bremer.<br><br>---<br><br>Lee: &quot;I have a good &#39;Fuck Grizz&#39; story.&quot;<br><br>---<br><br>Craps Crawl!<br><br>I believe this is the first official Craps Crawl since 2019.<br>The Westgate holds a table for us in the High Limit area.<br>The dealers, box men and box woman are very friendly and get us.<br><br>I&#39;m coaching John Lloyd as I am a craps expert having lost several<br>thousands of dollars playing this game.  My estimate in $10,000 <br>mostly in my 20s.<br><br>First thing we discuss is that you don&#39;t say the word &quot;seven&quot; at<br>the craps table.  You don&#39;t think it.  You don&#39;t say things like<br>&quot;Come on 6 or 8.&quot; as the craps gods will average that to a 7.<br><br>Around the table: Bremer, Showalter, Kuntz, Oliver, Steve W., <br>Randal, Kluchman, John Lloyd and me.<br>Bremer is the first shooter.  2, 12, 6, 7.<br>Nice work Rich.  I&#39;m stuck $38 before we&#39;ve even ordered drinks.<br><br>Waitress arrives.  While I&#39;m famous for drinking 7&amp;7s, this is <br>tantamount to treason at a craps table.  For craps, I drink<br>Harvey Wallbangers.  We are banging dice against a wall, so it works.<br>Bremer and I try to order Wallbangers.  The waitress does not know<br>this drink!  OMG.  How old am I?  I explain what it is and I think<br>the bartender got it right.<br><br>---<br><br>Showalter is betting the Don&#39;ts a bit.  All of us are losing badly<br>as none of us can hold the dice for more than 2 or 3 minutes.<br>I think I rolled a come-out 11 to stem the tide.<br>I&#39;m down about $150 and I&#39;ll quit if I lose $200.<br><br>Oliver finally puts together a roll.  He makes four passes and rolls<br>a lot of numbers to help out the place bettors.<br>We are high-fiving Oliver.<br><br>---<br><br>I hit a couple of passes and bet a &quot;Horn High Yo&quot; in Kevan&#39;s honor.<br>I roll the 11 for a $20 pass line win and $27 from the Horn bet.<br><br>---<br><br>John Lloyd gets the dice and goes on a nice run.  I lost track, but<br>I think he made 6 passes with a come-out yo in there.<br>Many high fives with John as everyone is digging out of deep holes.<br><br>I count my chips.  I&#39;m up $8!  This feels like a $150 win at this point.<br>I just stand around as John keeps rolling and winning money for everyone.<br>I toss out a $1 yo and a couple of $1 hardways. <br><br>Finally, I quit up $5.  Yes JZK, I locked up the win.<br><br>I checked back maybe 40 minutes later and it looked like everyone <br>was losing again.  Saddenz.<br><br>Someone tell me if I&#39;m wrong, but I think I won the craps crawl.<br><br>Anyway, it was a lot of fun and John and Oliver are my new heroes.<br><br>---<br><br>Dealer&#39;s Choice Ring Game<br><br>Table: Dan N.
