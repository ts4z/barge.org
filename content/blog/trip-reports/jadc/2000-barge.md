{{< tab >}}\*I had a great time, and missed at least half the fun. Even though
Thur-Sat were supposed to be for BARGE, family obligations limited me to
"official" events.

{{< tab >}}\*Rick (RLM) was the first BARGEr I saw. He made me feel welcome and
got me started in the right direction for the HOP.

{{< tab >}}\*Don Perry is a class act. If I had to get busted out of the NLHE,
I'm glad that my new friend Don got my bounty chips.

{{< tab >}}\*Andy Hughes was also helpful to a BARGE newbie. He got my bounty in
the HOP. I'm glad my chip went to a collector.

{{< tab >}}\*NewJane made a trip away from a live game, to the banquet to meet
my wife. She is a gem.

{{< tab >}}\*Then there was Schemengie Mitch, and Beth, Ken, Jerrod, Ken, Sleepy
Sam6, q, J.P., KidZee, Chuck, Andy, Steven, Charles, Tom, and so many
others. All made me welcome and included me in their conversations, even
though I didn't pay for the IC on my name badge, or learn the s00per
seecrit handshake.

{{< tab >}}\*I was supposed to call Lee Munzer on Monday but I wrote down his
e-mail addy instead of his phone number. 

{{< tab >}}\*I was 26th on the wait list for the TOC style, and as we were
changing hotels that day, I didn't go to Binion's. At the calcutta Randy
tells me they called my name for a seat. I wish I had known tables were
being added. Oh well, next year I'll sign up early.

{{< tab >}}\*Why all the moaning about the 5-stud rounds in the HOP? They were
the only rounds I picked up any chips.  :-D

{{< tab >}}\*I had two shots at ploink's CD but the pocker gods sent me a Q,
drawing one to a 6 and gave him a 9 drawing two. I don't remember much
about the second chance.

{{< tab >}}\*In the NLHE I bust 5 people and collect one bounty, a cherry from a
virgin.

{{< tab >}}\*173 of you should be ashamed of yourselves, letting the Colorado
fish make the final table.

{{< tab >}}\*I was ecstatic about reaching the final table and finishing 10th in
my first BARGE NLHE, then Scottro r00ls to 4th! Aces to you, Scott.

{{< tab >}}\*The WSOP jackets are great. Mine is more important to me than the
$208. After all I get to keep the jacket, Donna got the $200 ($8 to the
dealers) (that's close to 4% isn't it?).

{{< tab >}}\*My thanks to Bill Chen for showing his Aces after I muck As-Ks face
up to his all-in reraise.

{{< tab >}}\*When I catch up to QB to buy the "joke" BARGE chips, he asks if I
want to buy half my action back. He explains that no one knows me and
they were bidding on the other guy.  :-D  I pass, then cash in the
tourney.

{{< tab >}}\*Maverick is nothing like I imagined him. I still say he is not the
same since he left Chico State.

{{< tab >}}\*Disneyland sucks!

{{< tab >}}\*Knott's Berry Farm is tolerable.

{{< tab >}}\*It's kind of ironic that in L.A., a city where the air is so brown
that walking down the street breathing is equivalent to smoking a pack
of cigarettes, you can't smoke anywhere in public.

{{< tab >}}\*Fourteen and a half hours is one hell of a long drive home.
    
{{< tab >}}\*It's good to be home.
