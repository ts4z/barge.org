Let&rsquo;s first examine the meaning of OUTSIDER shall we?

The Merriam-Webster dictionary's first definition of &quot;outsider&quot; is as follows:

out&middot;sid&middot;er noun  (/ˌoutˈsīdər/) 1. a person who does not belong to a particular group

Well, there it is.  You don&rsquo;t belong to a particular group. Yet, at one
time or another we have all been &ldquo;outsiders&rdquo;.  We started at a new
school, we are dragged to a social gathering on the coattails of a significant
other, we walk into a job interview, all examples of being on the outside
looking in.  This can be very intimidating and depending upon interactions from
this moment on, it sets the tone for the rest of your association with that
particular entity.  This is a time when we feel most vulnerable and probably
tend to hide behind our most comfortable habits: being shy, being loud, being
quiet, etc.

I know, I was once a Barge outsider (i.e. Virgin, Newbie, etc...).  I attended
my first Barge in 2001 with Dave Lawful, then my supervisor, because we both
loved poker and he wanted me to experience this thing they call BARGE. I was
just starting my journey into casino poker and had never played a tournament in
my life.  We arrived at Binion's where BARGE was being held, and the first
thing I see is an almost full poker room.

It was loud, people were laughing, people were talking about all matter of
subjects, from &ldquo;Hey, how&rsquo;s the family?&rdquo; to the relative
merits of string theory.  Everyone seemed to be having a great time and every
once in a while, there would be a slight pause in the conversations as they
checked their cards, folded, called or raised, and then went back to their
discussions.  I went up to get my BARGE badge with Dave and was introduced to a
person that I can now call one of my best friends, Peter Secor.  Peter is one
of the &ldquo;original&rdquo; BARGErs from back in the day when it was a small
number of people who gathered in Vegas every August to blow of some steam and
have fun.

Peter, to me, is the quintessential BARGEr.  He is personable, funny, smart,
and plays one hell of a game of poker.  Anyway, Peter welcomed me to BARGE and
we have been friends ever since.  I got into a low stakes cash game, 3-6 limit,
and sat down.  Everyone at the table introduced themselves, and thus began my
first BARGE experience.  I won&rsquo;t bore you with the details but I will
provide some insight into what BARGE is to me.

## BARGE, first and foremost, is a gathering of very disparate folks with a single common goal, to have fun in Las Vegas.

This fun takes on multiple forms, some during the BARGE list of sanctioned
events and most, decidedly not.  The sanctioned events are mostly in the form
of tournaments for poker, video poker, black jack, the symposium (Mostly a
board of directors meeting with light food and drink.  May include some
gambling-like activities), and the banquet.  There's usually more unsanctioned
events at BARGE, some of which are the Golf Death March (playing golf in Vegas
in August), the sushi outing, the various smokers and non-smokers and of
course, my favorite, Karaoke.

## Secondly, BARGE is a community.

All sappiness aside, I have come to know and care about many members of this
community and they care about me as well.  An example of this for me was during
my first Barge, I lost my wallet.  As my wife can attest, I would lose my head
if it wasn&rsquo;t attached and that is why she has attended every Barge with
me since my solo excursion in 2001.  Anyway, unbeknownst to me, my friend Dave
had just casually mentioned this at one of the cash games.  A Barger, who shall
remain nameless, started to take up a collection to help me get through the
rest of the week as I had later found my wallet, sans the cash.  As it turned
out, I was able to get through without the financial assistance but I was
overwhelmed by the generosity they showed a newbie, outsider if you will, and I
will be forever grateful for that.

## Finally, BARGE is what you make it.

I never felt pressured to do this or to play that.  BARGE, at its core, is just
a series of opportunities. There are opportunities to play tournaments,
opportunities to play casino games, opportunities to make new friends,
opportunities to hang out with old friends.  There is no judgment, you are
welcome to come and go as you please but just remember that you are **ALWAYS
WELCOME**.

After my first BARGE I was hooked. I was no longer an outsider, I was part of
the BARGE community and all that entails.  I look forward each year to trekking
to Vegas for BARGE and me and the wife use that time as one of our yearly
vacations.  Hopefully, I have given you a feel for what you can expect at
BARGE.  Now, I would like to provide some pointers for the BARGE first timer
that may help you overcome your feeling of &quot;outsiderness&quot;.

* Read all you can about Barge.  All information about BARGE can be found at
  www.barge.org.  There is a very detailed description of the long and storied
  history of BARGE in all its gory detail.
* All BARGErs wear the customary BARGE Badge.  These badges are created for you
  by the organizers and you can only get one if you have signed up for BARGE at
  www.barge.org.  Signup opens up around the May-June time frame each year,
  watch the [BARGE Email list](/mailing-lists) for more details.  These badges
  are how we identify other BARGErs, both old timers and new comers.  When you
  arrive at the host casino, please come up and introduce yourself to anyone
  wearing said badge.  If not, the Welcoming Committee, of which I am a member,
  will seek you out and introduce you anyway so, you might as well do it
  yourself.
* BARGE your way is the best way to go with your first experience.  Some, like
  me, jumped right in and try to fit as much BARGE as possible into the time I
  had available.  Others pick and choose their BARGE experiences.  Whatever
  fits your comfort level, GO FOR IT!
* Try to sign up for as many &ldquo;unofficial&rdquo; BARGE events as possible.
  These are usually low key, adhoc mixers which sometimes focus loosely on an
  interest the folks have (Escape Rooms, pinball, paintball, strip clubs, mini
  golf, Sushi outing, local attractions like the Mob Museum or Neon Graveyard,
  etc ).  These events ideas show up on the [BARGE Email List](/mailing-lists)
  (another reason to sign up for the BARGE Email list) starting in June or July
  when BARGE sign up opens.  There is usually a single person or groups that
  are the defacto &ldquo;organizers&rdquo; that answer questions and get head
  counts for these events.  Then you just show up at the designated place at
  the designated time and off you go.  These are a great way to meet other
  BARGErs and maximize your fun quotient.
* Get a copy of the BARGE-At-A-Glance (BAAG) schedule of events.  This can be
  found in several ways.  You can find links to it on the [BARGE Email
  List](/mailing-lists), at [www.barge.org](/) and sometimes you can find a
  stack printed out at our host casino.  This is as comprehensive a list (date,
  time, location) that you can find for both sanctioned and unsanctioned BARGE
  events as well as many of the local daily tournaments around Vegas.  It's
  definitely a must have for any BARGEr.
* Sign up for and post any and all BARGE related questions on the [BARGE Email
  List](/mailing-lists) at barge@barge.org.  Many of the members will be glad
  to answer your queries.
* The Barge Welcome Committee usually holds a mixer for all first-time BARGErs
  to help ease them into the BARGE experience.  Look for it on the BARGE Email
  List.

I have always thought of BARGE as the world&rsquo;s largest home game.  So sit
down, have a drink, play a little cards, relax and enjoy yourself!

As Peter Secor says when asked about BARGE &quot;There are no strangers here,
just friends you haven't met yet...&quot;.

Hope to see you at Barge.
