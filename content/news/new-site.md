title: 'New Site'

We have rebuilt the site on newfangled technology.  Many things are updated,
but some are not.  Many things have moved but all the old links should still work.

Some pages have yet to be reformatted to match the rest of the site.  This may
get fixed.

If anything isn't working, please let [Tim](tim.showalter@gmail.com) know.

If it's just ugly, just let it go.  Or [edit it yourself and send us a
PR](https://github.com/ts4z/barge.org/).
