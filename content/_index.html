This is HTML, not Markdown, because of some unfortunate interactions with the banner
and other components that leave a stray p close tag due to a bad interaction between
Markdown and Hugo shortcodes.  It's OK to convert this back to Markdown
but make sure the validation passes.

<h2> BARGE is the most fun you can have while playing poker. </h2>

<p>
<a href="barge/">BARGE</a> is the Big August Rec.Gambling Excursion, typically held the
week leading up to the first Saturday in August, in Las Vegas, Nevada.  BARGE
is also an online community of poker enthusiasts associated with that event.
Our event features several poker tournaments, mixed cash games, a few very

<a href="rulebook/binglaha.html">cash</a>
<a href="rulebook/action-razz.html">games</a>,
as well as a wide variety of
non-poker related activities including dinners, karaoke, a golf outing, a sushi
outing, a fun run, room escapes, shows, and shopping. Activities vary from
year to year and are based on whatever people choose to organize.
</p>

<p>
Since 2011, we have also hosted a winter event, <a href="embargo/">EMBARGO</a>.
Members of our community also host a variety of <a href="other-events/">other events</a>
all over the US.
</p>

<p>
Our members communicate throughout the year
via <a href="/resources/mailing-lists/">email</a>, Facebook, Twitter,
<a href="/other-events/">other events</a>, or even informally.  The
BARGE event began in <a href="/barge/1991/">1991</a> as a meet-up of the
rec.gambling newsgroup, and membership has grown significantly over the years.
Members come from all professions and ages.  Our members include over 20 WSOP
bracelet winners as well as other major tournaments (WPT, WSOP
Circuit). Although many of our members have backgrounds in technology, science,
and the law, we welcome people to join regardless of their professional
backgrounds or poker accomplishments.
</p>

<h2> Why Join Us? </h2>

We're a diverse community of
fun-loving people. We all enjoy the game of poker. We have several WSOP
bracelet winners among us, and we have novice players.  We host

enhanced their poker skills via BARGE.
</p>
<p> But the most important reason to join
is: it's the most fun you will ever have playing poker! BARGE is what poker
should be!
