<h2> BARGE is the most fun you can have while playing poker. </h2>

<p>
  <a href="barge/">BARGE</a> is the Big August Rec.Gambling Excursion, typically held the
week leading up to the first Saturday in August, in Las Vegas, Nevada.  BARGE
is also an online community of poker enthusiasts associated with that event.
Our event features several poker tournaments, as well as a wide variety of
non-poker related activities including dinners, karaoke, a golf outing, a sushi
outing, a fun run, room escapes, shows, and shopping. Activities can vary from
year to year and are based on whatever people choose to organize.
</p>

<p>
  In recent years, we have also hosted a winter event, <a href="embargo/">EMBARGO</a>.
</p>

<p>
Our members communicate throughout the year via email, Facebook, Twitter, and
other means (including in person).  The BARGE event began in 1991 and
membership has grown significantly over the years.  Our members come from all
professions and ages.  The poker accomplishments of our members include over 20
WSOP bracelet winners as well as other major tournaments (WPT, WSOP
Circuit). Although many of our members have backgrounds in technology, science,
and the law, we welcome and encourage people to join regardless of their
professional backgrounds or poker accomplishments.
</p>
