BARGE is the most fun you can have while playing poker...
===============

This is the home of BARGE, the Big August Rec.Gambling Excursion. BARGE is an
online community of poker enthusiasts that hosts an annual event (of the same
name) in Las Vegas, NV typically during the week leading up to the first
Saturday in August. The event features several poker tournaments, as well as a
wide variety of non-poker related activities including dinners, karaoke, a golf
outing, a sushi outing, a fun run, room escapes, shows, and
shopping. Activities can vary from year to year and are based on whatever
people choose to organize. In recent years, we have also hosted a winter event,
known as EMBARGO.

Our members communicate throughout the year via email, Facebook, Twitter and
other means (including in person).  BARGE began in 1991 and membership has
grown significantly over the years.  Our members come from all professions and
ages.  The poker accomplishments of our members include over 20 WSOP bracelet
winners as well as other major tournaments (WPT, WSOP Circuit). Although we do
find that many of our members have backgrounds in technology, science and the
law, we welcome and encourage people to join regardless of their professional
backgrounds or poker accomplishments.

BARGE Inc. is a 501(c)7 corporation registered in the State of Nevada.
