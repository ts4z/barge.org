Everyone,

As you know, EMBARGO 2026 will be held at Resorts World from January 29-31,
2026.  Well you thought you knew that, but it's wrong!  We are having a bonus
Sunday morning event, so EMBARGO 2026 is actually January 29 through February
1.

Below is the event schedule for EMBARGO 2026.  All events are $105+35 except
for the No Limit Hold'em Main Event, which is $145+35.  Reentry is available
for all events.  I will circulate the structures in a few weeks.  Registration
will open later this month.

Remember that our room block is only available until January 6, so please book
now if you want to take advantage of our group rate!  See
https://www.barge.org/embargo/2026/hotel-info/ for details.

Hope to see you there!

Rich
on behalf of the Organizers

**HAM & Pineapple** - This is a limit mix of Hold'em, Archie, Murder, and Crazy Pineapple.  Hat tip to QB!  Hawaiian pizza is optional.

**4 Card Chowaha** &mdash; This year instead of standard casino Chowaha (2 card
high only), the World Chowaha Championship will be [4 card high/low
Chowaha](/rulebook/four-card-chowaha.html).

**Mix Max Binglaha** &mdash; This will start at 9 handed / 4 card
[Binglaha](/rulebook/binglaha.html).  At 28 players we will go to 7 handed / 5
card Binglaha.  At 15 players we will go to / 5 handed 6 card Binglaha.  At 8
players we will go to 4 handed / 5 card Binglaha.  At 4 players we go to heads
up / 4 card Binglaha.  When the tournament reaches four players, the largest
stack will play the smallest stack heads-up, while the middle two stacks will
play each other heads-up.  The blind level for heads-up play will reset to the
beginning of the level during which 4-handed play ended.  The blind level for
the final will reset to the beginning of the level during which the first
heads-up match ended.

**No Limit Hold'em Main Event** &mdash; Just regular, good old, classic [No Limit Hold'em](/rulebook/texas-holdem.html).

**SECOR** &mdash; This is a limit mix of [Stud](/rulebook/stud.html), [Stud 8 or Better](/rulebook/stud-high-low-eight-or-better.html), [Chowaha (2 card high
only)](/rulebook/chowaha.html), [Omaha 8 or
Better](/rulebook/omaha-high-low-eight-or-better.html), and
[Razz](/rulebook/razz.html)

**Drawmaha Mix** &mdash; This is a limit mix of [Drawmaha](/rulebook/dramaha.html),
[Drawmaha Zero](/rulebook/dramaha-zero.html), [Drawmaha 49](/rulebook/dramaha-49.html), [Drawmaha 21](/rulebook/dramaha-21.html), and
[Dramadugi](/rulebook/dramadugi.html).  Hat tip to Grizz!
