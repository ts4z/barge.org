### Who is Eligible to Register for EMBARGO?

Registrations are available to anyone who wishes to join our community.
The organizers reserve the right to deny participation in any or all EMBARGO 
events to anyone, at their discretion.  Registrations must be performed 
online and by the registrant personally (no third-party registrations). 
An exception is made for Significant Others (although we have no Significant
Other events on the calendar for EMBARGO this year).

### Assignment of Registration

A registration is to be considered an exclusive agreement between the 
registrant and the Organizers, and may not be assigned to 
another party without their prior agreement.

### Cancellation of Events

Should any event (or all events) associated with EMBARGO be canceled, 
the limitation of liability is the amount of the fee paid for the 
canceled event.

### Non-Smoking

When held live, all EMBARGO events are non-smoking. 

### So Who Are the &quot;Organizers&quot; Anyway?

EMBARGO 2024 is being organized by
[Russ Fox](russ@barge.org),
[Rich Bremer](omaholic@barge.org),
[Jeff Deitch](blofeld@barge.org),
[Stevan Goldman](goldie@barge.org),
and
[Sharon Goldman](sharon@barge.org),
with more than occasional advice and emergency help from Chuck Weinstock and
Peter Secor, BARGE Organizers Emeritus. We also wish to give a &quot;shout
out&quot; to BARGE elder statesman and former organizer, Mike Zimmers.

### But I have a question/complaint/praise/gripe? Who should I contact?

Well, if you know who to praise, you can use the organizer emails above and
send them lots of love. However, if you have a complaint, gripe, or other issue
with anything you see above about EMBARGO (the event), remember that it is
organized by the organizers under the direction of the [BARGE,
Inc. directors](/inc/officers)&mdash;you should be talking to them
rather than the organizers.
