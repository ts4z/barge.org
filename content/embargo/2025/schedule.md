**SHESHE** is Simultaneous Hold'em and Super Hold'em.  Each player is dealt 5 cards and separates them into a regular Hold'em hand and a Super Hold'em hand (3 cards, play 0 1 or 2).  The pot is split between the best Hold'em and the best Super Hold'em hand.  This game will be played limit.

**Chaos NLHE** - This is a standard NLHE event, except that for this event, chaos erupts at the end of each level in three ways:
First, the button on table 1 rolls a regular die, with the outcome determining the level progression as follows (I may play around with what roll means what):
a roll of 1 means that blinds decrease one level
a roll of 2 means that the level stays the same
a roll or 3 or 4 means that the blinds increase one level
a roll of 5 means that the blinds increase two levels
a roll of 6 means that the blinds increase three levels
(note that on average, the blinds increase one level per roll)
Second, seats at each table are redrawn - no one moves tables, just the seats at each table are shuffled.
Third, the button is redrawn.

**SHORT** - This is shorthanded HORSE with triple draw replacing stud/8.  It will be played either five or six handed.

**Triple Draw Quick Quads** - This game is draw high with no joker, but if you have trips and your other two cards add up to 2-10 which matches your trips, you have quads.  For example, 88862 is quad eights.

I will circulate the structures when they are ready.  There may be a few tweaks as I put them together.

Hope to see you there!
