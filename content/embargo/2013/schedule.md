*This schedule was resurrected in 2026 from the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20130813052818/http://barge.org/embargo2013info.html) and is presented for historical interest.*

EMBARGO is the Extraordinary Mid-winter Big Annual Rec.Gambling Outing (also known as "winter BARGE" or "mini-BARGE). This is our third attempt at an off-season Las Vegas complement to the long-running BARGE event.

The official events for EMBARGO 2013 will begin on January 24 and end on January 26. It is possible that some of the details of the events will change between now and the opening of registration.

## EMBARGO At-A-Glance

Binion's: Friday, 1/25/2013: World Chowaha Championship @ 7:30pm. Entry: $60+$15+$10(\*\*)
Binion's: Saturday, 1/26/2013: Head's Up Double Elimination No-limit Hold'em @ 11:00am. Entry: $100+$20+$20(\*\*\*)

(\*) The Dealer's Choice game is just that, but it's not complete anarchy. Rules for the games that may be called in the Dealer's Choice event are available. Rules for the event itself are also available. Note, we are changing some options for this game around a little this year based on feedback we received. Please read the information on the rule change for more information. This link also contains the list of games that have been selected.

(\*\*) For those few of you who may not know the rules to casino Chowaha, it's high only, must use both hole cards from your hand, and the board is dealt out as Chowaha boards are usually dealt.

(\*\*\*) The Heads-up Double Elimination NLH event is limited to 64 entrants (for what we assume will be obvious reasons), so while unlikely, it's possible to get shut out for this event. After 64, we will waitlist people. If we have less than 64, some lucky players will get a bye in the first round and in the first round of the loser's bracket.

We plan to start the HU NLH event with 16 dealers. Some of the first round matches will be scheduled to start right at 11:00. The next batch will start as dealers free up. This means that for the first two rounds of the tournament only part of the field will be able to be in action at any one time. We don't want to have dealers sit idle, because we're paying for that. At the same time, we expect to have cash games available nearby for folks to have something to do while they wait for their opponents to resolve themselves and dealers to free up.
